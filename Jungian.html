		// TODO
		- each small group has 3 versions...expressed with two possible pairings. define them!
		- header with contents button
		- sources
		- never stop absorbing
		- map author names to their descriptions
		- list small groups in each pair (should be 7 per pair)
		- expand on polarities (i.e. separate descriptions for both positive & negative)
		- romance style etc. labels?
		- collapsible divs (per dichot, per tetra, per group) (i) (x) (+) (-)
		- replace popups with divs that expand underneath (need to put a div in every possible location, then programatically determine WHICH div to place content in...)
		- replace all tables with flex (esp. popup right header table)
		- figure out type/attitude picker (or at least make smaller on mobile)
		- test on many browsers & devices
		- finish all code label inputs (some are still blank)
		- upload

						"Victor Gulenko": [
							"In general terms, this dichotomy refers to orientation towards either space (Static) or time (Dynamic). The categories of space and time are vital a priori concepts studied in detail by Immanuel Kant in “Critique of Pure Reason”, contrasting them as extent and duration.",
							"Statics depend more on space, Dynamics more on time. Filling space with objects characterizes Static behavior, whereas Dynamics saturate time with events. Statics cannot stand empty spacethey immediately fill it with available items on hand. Dynamics cannot stand empty timeboredom, stagnation, prolonged states of the same condition. In a certain sense, Statics can be called people of place, Dynamics people of time.",
							"Now consider this dichotomy on the individual levels of communication.",
							"Intellectual Level",
							"Statics tend towards fragmentary-analytic thinking; Dynamics tend towards associative-synthetic thinking.",
							"Analysis, as defined by most sources, is the division of a whole into clearly delimited parts. Analytical work is meant to delineate boundaries. Whereas synthesis is akin to associativity, i.e. the association of two or more concepts by fuzzy, rapid connections whereby one occurrence immediately evokes others to mind. Resulting in a coherent synthetic image with blurred internal boundaries.",
							"The epitomization of Dynamic cognition formed the explanatory basis for the nature of mental processes in the theory of associationism. Aristotle first advanced the idea that spontaneous mental images can converge so closely together that the similarity or contrast of multiple associations emerges on the basis of contiguity. Later John Locke argued that ideas of any degree of complexity emerge from the process of associating simple sensations. In this case he contrasted the association of ideas against purely semantic connections, which in his opinion were secondary.",
							"Indeed, eidetic mnemonic techniques showed that with aid of visual association, it is possible to connect anything in the mind. Here are some of the eidetic memory techniques originating in antiquity.",
							"Roman orator Cicero used the ‘method of loci’ to memorize his speeches by heart. He mentally laid out information in the corners of a room, mentally returning to one corner or another to extract as required. Medieval Dominican monks studying rhetoric used the same method. They took a road familiar to them to the last detail and mentally walked down it, successively laying out along the road statements which would be presented before the audience. While speaking, they would mentally walk the route, ‘raising’ key concepts they had previously laid there.",
							"Contemporary advertising cleverly exploits the Dynamic side of human cognition. It is mainly based on the mechanism of association by context (manly cowboy next to a pack of cigarettes) or contrast (ordinary laundry detergent vs. advertised laundry detergent). Judging by this means of consumer inducement, advertising presumably influences Statics much less than Dynamics. Statics memorize more effectively when material is structured in rigid semantic relationships, where each concept is fixed in memory cells like a computer.",
							"Thus, Dynamics are stronger in synthesis operations (not mere simple connections, but confluence of associations), while Statics are stronger in analysis (not just any separation, but clear and precise delineations). Thus, the discrete/continuous pairing has more to do with the StaticDynamic dichotomy, than with otherwise customary Rationality/Irrationality. But then, what exactly is the latter? Irrationality indicates situationality (predominance of context over aim), while Rationality indicates regularity (predominance of aim over context).",
							"Social Level",
							"Differences between Dynamic and Static types at this level corresponds to the contrast between initiators and finalizers.",
							"Dynamics are stronger at the beginning of any activity: they easily move and quickly enter the realm of nominal activity. Rapid transitions from a previous state into a new process of change itselfthis is their customary life. Statics better sustain and continue what has already begunthat which is already in motion. They must be preliminarily excited.",
							"However, in the Dynamic is a process of continuous readjustment of focus and ‘drift’ of purposes. Because of this, the priorities of Dynamics are volatile and poor in hierarchical coordination. One wish may be quickly replaced by another and it is difficult for them to concentrate on any one specific long-term goal without external support. The strength of Dynamics is not in retaining goals, but in achieving them; they are better tacticians than strategists.",
							"The objectives of Statics are more stable and reliable. They know what they want and are able to maintain long-term focus upon it. They arrange priorities in their life and work, with well-differentiated primary and secondary objectives that are rarely reversed. Statics are more successful strategists than tacticians; they know what to do much better than how to do it.",
							"A predominance of Dynamics in any social group renders it unstable, prone to endless change, and sensitive to external interference. Conversely, if predominated by Statics, then rapid transformations prove to be impossible due to excess psychological inertia, rendering the group stabler but more conservative.",
							"Psychological Level",
							"The StaticDynamic dichotomy controls the degree of equilibrium in the nervous system. Generally, the nervous system of Statics can be regarded as balanced and Dynamics as unbalanced.",
							"This is tied to variability in the internal state commonly referred to as ‘mood’. The mood of Dynamics, even if Rational, can substantially change or fluctuate for seemingly insignificant reasons (from an outside observer POV). The Dynamic wants total freedom but is more dependent on ambient environmental conditions and needs a solid foundation.",
							"Statics possess a relatively autonomous psycho-emotional state; their mood is difficult to spoil, and equally difficult to raise. For Statics, providing reliable support to those psychologically depending on them is a routine situation.",
							"Dynamics often develop a psycho-physiological phenomenon known as ‘synaesthesia’a complex relationship between the sensory modalities that results in confluence between them. Synchronized perception of color, sound, smell, and taste as a single complex gives Dynamics a special vividness in their perception of reality. Sometimes fusion of sensation is developed to such an extent that internal images appear indistinguishable from reality. For Statics, given the discreteness of their mental apparatus, regular synesthesia is usually a rare exception or the result of special training.",
							"Physical Level",
							"At this level, StaticDynamic manifests as contrasting impulses to biological homeostasis/heterostasis. Homeostasis I understand as constancy and heterostasis as variability of the organism and its surrounding environment.",
							"Dynamics are heterostatically inclined to change their material conditions of life such as wardrobe, home interior, or furniture arrangement, for sake of variety or out of boredom. For Statics this tendency is uncharacteristic. Only with difficulty do they proceed with changes to their home environment to which they have become accustomed. They will do so only when it’s easier to yield to circumstantial pressures, than to resist.",
							"As types with variable metabolism, Dynamics can rapidly grow stout, though just as quickly lose weight if they fall into a state of emotional distress. Statics have the opposite problem, of a stabler weight and build: if already seriously fat (or thin), they remain so for longer times. Their bodily metabolism is more invariant.",
							"The same laws apply in relation to other physiological parameters such as temperature, blood pressure, perspiration, etc. For example, the body temperature of Dynamics may fluctuate during the day even with no overt symptoms of illness. With sufficient training, Dynamic types can consciously change these parameters in the desired direction."

							"On the social level, differences between these approaches can be contrasted as naturality/artificiality. By ‘naturality’ I refer to primal behavior inherent to nature, and by ‘artificiality’ I refer to behavior accepted by society. For example, in nature, survival of the fittest is law, whereas in society, protection and care of the weak is cultivated.",
							"From this stems distinctions in one’s attitudes towards people in close or distant circles. In the life of Evolutionary types, reputation plays a much greater role. Opinions of others in external society tend to be more important to them than opinions of friends or relatives. Involutionary types depend less on social appraisal. They are more accommodating towards people of their inner circle, whose opinions they hold in higher esteem than those of public approval or disapproval.",
							"There is a habit in Involutionary types to abruptly curtail conversations. They do not simply cut off communication, but specifically wind it up, quickly finish, or summarize what has been said. They may also suddenly deflect onto tangents, then flip back to the topic at hand. Evolutionary types may interpret this mannerism as a sign of tactlessness, disinterest, or resentment.",
							"Psychological Level",
							"EvolutionInvolution, along with other dichotomies, influences a key parameter of stress in the psyche: Control of asymmetry in the excitatory/inhibitory processes of the nervous system.",
							"Evolutionary types recover more slowly from stress than Involutionary types. Their inhibitory processes are less amenable to conscious control than their excitatory processes, hence their tendency to dwell on personal issues. After being pulled in by any process, they are often unable to get out of it. Which can lead to gambling, drug use, alcoholism, or other vices, even Internet-addiction.",
							"Consequently, susceptibility to conditioning is higher in Evolutionary types than in Involutionary types. Conditioned responses require movement along a single path, without possibility of turning around or deviating from the imposed route. One of the inhibitory mechanisms of conditioning is phobia (obsessive fear). Imagine not being able to rid yourself of thinking you will definitely fall on a slippery road. This is an example of a phobia. And then you actually do end up falling, even if wearing mountain-climbing boots. According to my observations, Involutionary types do not seriously suffer such phobias.",
							"Thus, Involutionary types more rapidly and less painfully get rid of illusions, imposed opinions, suggested thoughts, fanatic states, etc. It is because of EvolutionInvolution differences that quadras are split rings of social progress are formed.",
							"Physical Level",
							"The EvolutionInvolution dichotomy manifests on the lower level of communication through an orientation towards either process or result.",
							"Evolutionary types are more inclined to procedure, which involves careful study of details. They are subject to the logic of the development process, which assumes motion from beginning to end and top to bottom.",
							"Involutionary types rush to obtain a result, frequently neglecting details of the process, which reduces overall quality. Such behavioral patterns lead to a tolerant attitude towards returns and corrections. They don’t mind accepting suboptimal, but convenient solutions. They are characterized by backward motion, from end to beginning and from bottom to top.",
							"Let me illustrate this by an example of reading books. Glancing immediately at the end or bottom part of the page is characteristic for Involutionary types. Reading in reverse order does not deprive them pleasure of novelty, on the contrary, it stimulates their activity in assimilating information. Involution shouldn’t be confused merely with impatient skimming ahead, after which one continues smooth reading.",
							"Sharpness of movement is observed in Involutionary types, along with sporadic shifting from one activity to another. These sudden shifts overtly contrast to the smoothness of Evolutionary types. In traditional Socionics, sharp movements are attributed to Rationality. In my opinion, however, this quality is more determined by Involution. For counterexample, consider the Evolutionary Rational types LSI and EII, whose motions are characteristically soft and smooth. Yet the nature of movement in Involutionary Irrationals SLE and IEE is so sharp that training them smooth movement is practically impossible.",
							"To clarify the fundamental distinction between Involution and Evolution, the following analogy will help. In biology, catabolism and anabolism are the two sides of organic metabolism. Catabolismthe breakdown of complex compounds to release energy and the elimination of decay products from the organismcorresponds to the role of Involutionary types in group dynamics. Anabolismthe assimilation from the external environment of substances necessary for life and their transformation into more complex compoundscorresponds to the communicative role played by Evolutionary behavior."

							"At this level, the PositivismNegativism dichotomy manifests as identification of similarities or differences in object comparison. In Negativists thought processes prevails contrast, in Positivists leads comparison. Meaning that Positivists more easily hold overall views of an object, without considering its internal divisions. Conversely, Negativists more easily distinguish its extreme points of separation and opposing contrasts.",
							"Directly relevant to this is a dichotomy known in cognitive psychology as convergent/divergent thinking [5], discovered by J. P. Guilford. In his opinion, divergent thinking, from simple initial data, yields several different solutions to the same problem; a trait characteristic to the alternative-thinking of Negativists.",
							"Opposite this, convergent thinking searches for a single valid encompassing solution; a trait more characteristic to Positivist thinking. For them, a problem is unsolved until the validity of one solution is proven against other alternatives.",
							"Social Level",
							"PositivismNegativism affects the degree of internal group coherence and regulates attraction/repulsion between its members.",
							"An individual’s ability to assimilate into a group is typologically predictable. Negativists are remote types. They need constant assurance, even in a group they consider their own. Therefore it is more difficult to fully integrate Negativists into a group. Positivists on the other hand, are inclined to close range communication. They do not polarize contrasts, but smooth them over in one way or another. Thus Positivists facilitate monocentric group structure and unity of purpose. Whereas Negativists amplify polarizing forces conducive to polycentric group structure.",
							"Consider the example of SEI, a fairly good-natured type, although Negativist. Is there a behavioral tendency towards remoteness? Yes, it contrasts its subgroup with other subgroups. Thereby disrupting, unintentionally or not, unity of purpose in the whole group overall.",
							"What process balances internal group cohesion? It is observed that Positivists are drawn towards their opposite, which contributes to overall group solidarity, particularly through the ease of intragroup role distribution. Negativists on the other hand, have an inherent paradoxical attraction to those similar to themselves. The nearer such parallel charged elements converge, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to implement mutual action. Repulsive forces rapidly emerge and fracture group integration.",
							"The overall incidence of monolithic or polarized group behavior is a reliable index for gauging PositivistNegativist tendencies. Negativism generates tension in intragroup relations, leading on one hand to an increase in psychological distance between members, but on the other hand activating its internal momentum to say “Move!”. Positivism by contrast contracts psychological distance and encourages internal group cohesion, but can also bring complacency, carelessness, and ‘vapidity’ of existence.",
							"Psychological Level",
							"In a psychological sense, this dichotomy can be approximately interpreted as trust/distrust.",
							"Each type of person behaves in life according to how they answer the following existential question: is human nature inherently good or evil? For Positivists, human nature is inherently good, so they are more likely to be trusting. This does not mean that they consciously consider themselves to be good, just that they conduct themselves as if others were. Negativists even under favorable conditions are inclined to expect the worst. Their degree of trust in others is therefore is much lower.",
							"The relation between Positivists and Negativists is illustrated well by the analogy of electric conductors. Electric-people (Negativists who have accumulated a negative psychological charge) discharge into conductor-people (Positivists), who tend to provoke them in just the right way to do so. All of which happens mostly automatically and unconsciously. The resulting emotional flash establishing temporary balance of psychological (electro-)potentials.

							"Automatic reductions in confrontation due to being seated side by side, are a common method used by marital psychologists working with couples. Sitting side by side and addressing an imaginary third party, enables couples to gradually decrease the severity of sore conflict.",
							"Clinical psychologists studying nonverbal cues classify gestures indicative of critical attitudes. Such gestures are typically ‘closed’for instance, a hand at the mouth. From a Socionics standpoint then, closed demeanor is better explained by Negativism, not Introversion.",
							"Negativism induces tangible bodily tension. Negativists are inclined to accumulate ‘charge’, making highly-charged Negativists easily overexcitable (especially if also Dynamic). In order to compensate against this, Negativists are recommended to engage in physical exercise that relaxes and smooths internal tension.

The third four are not in a hurry, it is swift as a hurricane, its environment itself suggests that it is necessary to make a breakthrough. It is on such a jerk that everything is accomplished, “the main thing is to catch the wave,” because the child either breaks through with force or moves to the rhythm of the fight-movement. Those. You can either overcome the resistance of the medium, or you can use the oscillating motion of the medium.",
							"The bearers of this aspect are always in a hurry somewhere, even when they are far from young, they rush around like shuttles, not knowing they are tired. But no one knows, even they, where they will be carried to the next second. For these types of situations, situations are urgent, when something urgently needs to be done, although I did not intend to, or we must gallop somewhere, although there was nothing like that in our thoughts.",
							"These are people-sprinters, they have the highest starting speed, both physiological and psychological. I think many representatives of this four were caught when they were told “eh?”, And the answer was “Oh, come on!”. The more unexpected the proposal, the better, the steeper the turn will be, the more adrenaline will be in the blood \"the main thing is to get involved in the battle, but we'll see.\" It is for the third subgroup that it is typical to break off and run, and then change your mind, make an elusive movement or an inconceivable somersault and run exactly in the opposite direction.",
							"The life of these people is the way through thorns to the stars. The main thing ? wait for the acceleration in the right direction or give this acceleration yourself. There are no hopeless situations here, \"there is always a way out.\" Often, carriers of this aspect like to do everything at the last moment, but their motivation is completely different than that of the previous four. They still break through, so while there are still many loopholes, you can do other things. As a result, it turns out that the first exit that came to hand is used, but these types are always \"visible at the end of the tunnel.\" And they miraculously always or almost always “crawl” through this “tunnel”. The third subgroup itself takes the initiative. The word \"wait\" is not from their lexicon, unless it is an expectation of the same wave.",
							"A workplace in any place is not the best solution for these people, because then she will not be aware of all the events, and this is important. Native element is a train compartment, an airplane seat or a driver's seat. Around the carriers of this aspect, everything must constantly change, everything must be in motion, so a business trip to such a person who sat in one place is like a breath of fresh air, like spring water on a hot afternoon. Governor of St. Petersburg V.Matvienko (SLE) with his activity often illustrates this statement. She didn’t have time to come from Moscow, they show a report from Japan, where she was ahead of Luzhkov. She did not have time to return from Tokyo, she was already in Helsinki.",
							"Such activity was also characteristic of B. Yeltsin (SLE). In the evening there was still nothing foreshadowed any changes, but at six in the morning the windows were lit - it means that the resignation of the government or the prime minister. In general, to make some unexpected maneuver that no one expected, so as to surprise the whole world, is the style of the First President of Russia. For example, after the march through half-Serbia, to seize the airport in Pristina - “this is such a squiggle”. This unpredictability largely determined foreign and domestic policies in the nineties of the last century.",
							"Representatives of this aspect can be wrapped in any direction, this is achieved thanks to a truly feline plastic, but unlike introverts-irrationals, they are wrapped not inwards but by a screw, or the letter “Z”. It is in the process of passing through the birth canal that the child changes the position of the body, as if screwing into the birth canal and making three and a half turns around its axis. Looking at the representatives of this aspect, the idea comes by itself that they continue to be screwed to this day.",
							"The poses of these people are not just open, they are poses with maximum readiness to start at any second, helping to develop that very high speed “right off the bat.” Also characterized by promiscuous rapid gesticulations, sharp turns, sharp wide sweeps with their hands, either helping to change direction, or helping to balance over the precipice. This plastic looks particularly impressive in the dance, sometimes it seems that these people simply do not have bones, and maybe more joints. Smooth fast movements replace one another. If we look at the color of Russian figure skating, we find that the majority of figure skaters belong to the types included in this matrix. A. Tarkovsky (ILE), I. Lobacheva (SLE), I. Averbukh (IEE), I. Slutskaya (SLE), A. Zhulin (SLE).",
							"Only representatives of these types are able to find adventure out of the blue. Roll down the mountain where no one is rolling, and miraculously do not break their bones, go to Germany to rest and get under a raid on anti-globalists. These comrades love risky decisions, and this risk is not always justified. Difficult, crisis situations are called and lured, magically attracting. To get into a difficult situation, and then find a way out of it, this is what drive is so little understandable to other people. This gives a taste for life, the sharpness of existence with an increased level of adrenaline.",
							"The view of the third four is very lively, never stands still, its focus moves from object to object. It can not be fixed or caught for a long time. This is clearly seen in A. Abdulov (IEE), M. Rasputina (SLE), A. Pugacheva (SLE), S. Farady (IEE). Speech is quite fast, often these types swallow letters, and even words, trying to bring the speed of speech closer to the speed of thought. In terms of reaction speed, this matrix is the fastest in socion. Often, these people do something at first, reacting to the impulse that has arisen, and then they think “why?”, “Was it necessary?”.

If you can not get up, it is better not to get up, if you can not reach, it is better not to reach. If you can curl up with this, then you have to curl up. The characteristic posture of the first matrix is precisely the contraction. If a person is just sitting on a chair, he collapses his body like a crustacean, closing from the outside world. If a person sits in a chair or on the couch, the poses become more intricate shapes, often the legs are picked up, which further increases wrapping. In this case, the body, as well as in the womb, takes all the different forms, folds and bends in any parts and in \"any\" directions. You can observe how the chosen legs are still wrapped around their hands.",
							"In general, the postures of the bearers of this aspect are always closed poses, the hands are joined, crossed or clasp the body, if the situation forces one to sit “as it should be”, it means that they are simply pressed tightly to the body. The legs are shifted or crossed, the body is fed back. Change of posture is a barely perceptible movement of the muscles, a person “shimmers” from one posture to another, and you can see how the movement is transmitted from one muscle group to another.",
							"The look is always inward; you can often notice that big eyes are looking somewhere nowhere. We can say that the first subgroup has “widely closed eyes”. Those. as the fetus did not look at anything in the womb, so in the adult state it continues to “see nothing”.

							"“In the last four processes go on increasing, gradually picking up speed. In this subgroup everything is done quickly, but not abruptly, the environment of the fourth matrix implies that it is necessary to adapt to new conditions. Those. first, as if to try new conditions for viability and, getting used to them, unfold and accelerate.",
							"Muscle clamps, characteristic of rational introverts, are also present here, but not so pronounced. These people less than all others in the socion can sit without movement, more precisely, they can not at all. Stay in pinched poses, cramped conditions is most difficult to bear. Even the active third subgroup at the expense of statics - squeezing in the birth canal in such cases freezes, waiting for the “new wave”. For the last four spaces are needed, endless spaces, the pattern of these types of “new horizons opened up” and movement. “Joy is in movement, if movement is in joy,” it’s true that people belonging to these types generate quite a lot of movements themselves, but it is under these conditions that the activity of the fourth aspect is most active, productive and comprehensive.",
							"Unconsciously, this is expressed in the desire to get into the new world and act there in its own way, so that no one interferes, no one overshadows the horizons. To open some new area of activity, a new hobby for oneself, and to open one's eyes in surprise: “There is a field not plowed in the same place”. It is these wide-open eyes from surprise, from delight, because it captures the spirit from the vast expanses, and distinguish the closing four from all others. Despite the high reaction rate, in carriers of this aspect, one can notice how, once in a new situation, a person freezes, as his perception changes. Sometimes this process takes place rather quickly and remains unnoticed by external observers and the man himself, but he is always there.",
							"To see at least somewhere in the gap “there is enough eye” is simply unbearable. Each representative of the latter aspect surely knows several places, from where a magnificent view opens up, a panoramic overview. This could be a ferris wheel, an observation deck of the tower, or a view from the cliff at the setting sun. In general, the attitude to the sunrises and sunsets from the fourth matrix is special, intimate.",
							"The desire to expand in all directions and causes the organization of the workplace, these people need a review, whether it is a view from the window or a view of the office space, where they can look at everyone. This also applies to work, in this subgroup everything is concerned, although it sometimes leads to dispersion, not expansion, but nonetheless. The narrowing of perception for these types, the concentration on one issue, rather uncomfortable state.",
							"These people do not like when the problems that arise obscure their view “on the open field”, they do not allow them to think big, so they try to prevent and eliminate them while they are still points on the horizon. The desire to clear the debris, remove restrictions, give room to themselves and people can be traced in various areas of human activity.",
							"The first task of this group? show the whole socion these open horizons. It is from these types closer to the end of the course, when people begin to understand what socionics is, I hear enthusiastic exclamations from what socionics can give and how much remains to be done. And the second task is to bring everyone there. Those. not just to break through \"through thorns to the stars,\" but to discover new worlds there.",
							"To see new horizons and bring socion to a new level, one must possess superpowers and supernormal abilities. You have to be the best of all, and this is another pattern of the fourth aspect. This is the top four superheroes, supermen, the league of the best of the best. It should be noted that this thesis does not mean that the representatives of this matrix are really the best or all the best people on the planet to belong only to the fourth matrix, this is the broadcast and projected personal perception. Including in the literature Conan Doyle (ESE), J. Vern (LIE), R. Jelazny (LIE), A. Dumas (ESE), and others, which well illustrates the tendency to endow significant people with super qualities.",
							"The activity of representatives of the fourth aspect is wide and large-scale. The most positive example in Russian history, illustrating this statement, the transformations carried out by PA Stolypin (FEL). The transformations of MS were no less large. Gorbachev (ESE), consistently to this day, showing openness to the world and calling for the whole world.",
							"The fourth matrix deals with everything, its platform for activity is the whole world. Representatives of these four should not be urged to think big, small problems are not interesting in principle. If social issues are considered, then globalization, if environmental issues, global warming. If the boots were dusty for Russian soldiers, then wash them in the Indian Ocean, as V.V. Zhirinovsky (EIE).",
							"The idea of the fourth matrix is most vividly observed in the US culture. The first settlers, mastering a new world for Europe, probably, for the most part belonged to the fourth matrix, as the most restless and therefore fleeing crowded Europe. But, another option is possible, the new boundless world has provided preferential conditions for its own realization to the carriers of the fourth aspect. It is in the USA that the idea of limitless possibilities is cultivated, which is very positive from a psychological point of view and brings good results.",
							"Against this background, the presidents ’choice of three aspect carriers over the past two decades is completely natural: R. Reagan (LIE), G. Bush (Art.) (FEL), B. Clinton (LIE).",
							"It is in the culture of the USA that superman stories are so popular: Superman, Batman, Spiderman, X-Men, etc. Here is another pattern of the fourth matrix - all-powerful helpers who come to the most difficult moment to help. This is nothing more than a reflection of obstetric intervention in the psyche.",
							"The posture bearers of the aspect prefer smooth and open. Wide active gestures are characteristic, with both hands making the same movements. The change of poses is not as pronounced as in the second matrix, it is as if slightly blurred by a slow start of movement and a slow end.",
							"The look in this four is wide-open eyes that look around at once the whole panorama, these people have a panoramic vision. The muscles of the face and especially the eye area are also quite active, often changing. A similar view can be observed in J. Friske (ESE), D. Bilan (EIE), E. Vorobey (LIE), G. Khazanov (FEL).",

							"“In the second subgroup, all processes periodically freeze as it were. Presented the second aspect is also not in a hurry and in no hurry, it is in cramped conditions, where there is no way out. The fruit, being clamped by the uterine muscles, the rest of his life retains this clamped plastic. The movements of the second matrix are scant movements of necessity, they are always minimal and quite limited, gestures seem to run into an invisible barrier. Often, the types of the second matrix take a pose in which they rest against something, be it a pose, with their fist propped on their head — Roden's thinker, or with their elbows or shoulders on some piece of furniture.",
							"The representatives of the second aspect of the most visible muscle clamps, especially in the shoulder girdle. Sometimes it seems that they are bent only in the belt or not bent at all in the literal and figurative sense. These people longer than all other members of the socion can sit in one position absolutely straight, without changing it for hours. From personal observations, I can say that sitting for two hours in a fixed position (absolutely motionless!) For the representatives of the second matrix does not present any difficulty, a record that I observed in the group - three and a half hours without any movements.",
							"In the psyche, such a pattern manifests itself in the inertia of mental processes: “I can think for a long time with one thought, I can feel one feeling for a long time”. Another football example, but with our player. The next attack ended in vain, striker V. Onopko (LII), possessing the ball, did not make a timely transfer to the penalty area and could not accurately break through on goal. Describing this game episode in an interview, he commented on the situation: “I am running and I think, to beat or not to beat”. While Onopko thought, he ran half of the football field: “I think there is no place to run any further. Need to beat. Hit Past the gate.",
							"The situation when there is no “way out” is characteristic of the carriers of the second aspect, it is in such conditions that she feels most comfortable and begins to be active. It is in such conditions that the greatest efficiency and readiness to take the initiative is manifested.",
							"Since the fetus in the generic process has not yet separated itself from the environment, and the environment is hostile and restricts it, and the struggle with the environment has not yet begun, in the future this external restrictor is introjected and perceived as its internal restriction. “I have to educate myself”, “I have to restrain myself”, only from the representatives of the second matrix I heard the expression “socionics limits me”. For people who unconsciously copy this pattern, in most cases painful reflections are inherent: “I am trembling creature or I have the right”, doubts “can I”.",
							"Often the unconscious desire to recreate its matrix is expressed in the desire to get into difficult situations in which circumstances \"dictate\" behaviors. This may be delaying the solution of the issue until the very last moment, when there is no way out, except for how to take the only possible (not the most optimal) solution. This may be an unconscious ignoring of circumstances aggravating the situation, until negative factors reach a critical level. Another good way was suggested by the aspect bearer? to commit oneself to commitments: promised, fulfill, creating something like a debt pit for yourself.",
							"This is clearly visible on the management style, for example, in neighboring Belarus. Constant crises, difficulties, constrained living conditions of the Belarusian people often look artificial, for example, the signing on December 31 at 23:55 of the next gas contract for the next year. This is the result of the policy pursued by the famous “father” Lukashenko (LSI). This situation is clear and familiar, the US is arresting accounts, the European Union does not allow officials, Russia closes the gas valve.",
							"Life in cramped conditions is a familiar environment for the second subgroup: “I don’t see a way out,” “I don’t see a resolution of the situation.” Where it is possible to take some measures in advance to prevent a deterioration of the situation or simply to create better conditions, the second matrix waits patiently for it to become completely unbearable. If the contract ends, these people wait for the last day when the validity period will expire, and only after that they start looking for work. As a rule, constrained material conditions make it impossible to find an attractive option. If the company falls apart, they are the last to be fired, when there is simply nowhere to go to work, and the closed door causes them to change their usual trajectory.",
							"Of course, not all representatives of the second aspect bring the situation to a catastrophic situation, it depends on personally acceptable limits, but the described “forcedness” is observed in all.",
							"For bearers of the aspect of the workplace, when the table is in such a way that, apart from the wall, no one is visible, it does not cause negative emotions. In one of the groups on the assignment of organizing the space of the lady, LII, putting the maximum number of tables, spread all the prospective employees face to the walls, which put the rest of the training participants in a state of shock.",
							"Such isolation from everyone allows not to waste extra forces, not to be distracted by trifles, since a lot of energy is spent on switching.",
							"Change of direction, change of posture, change of activity is always clearly defined. It was so, it became different, there is always a point of refraction, the further motion vector is always clear. Turns only the entire body, the head turns with the body, the eyes look only where the head is turned.",
							"These people also prefer closed poses, but, unlike the previous aspect, they do not fold here, but sit flat. The pose has clear angles, because the situation “always forces one to sit as it should be,” elbows pressed.",
							"A glance can also be called a glance in oneself, more precisely, self-deepened and intense. The eye zone is quite intense at the muscle clamps, a look, as a rule, fixed, in one point. A similar view can be observed in A. Serebryakov (LII), in A. Adabashyan (LSI), in D. Borisova (ESI).",
							"Speech, as well as in the first aspect, is slow, but not painful. There are no jumps from topic to topic in this matrix, the conversation is supported in one direction. According to the reaction rate, this subgroup is the slowest, the first reaction is expectant, the second reaction is expectant, the third reaction is expectant and only, when it is no longer possible to wait, these types are included in the activity. Of course, this position does not imply active intervention."

							"“After the critical work of the third quadra the way is cleared to enter the arena for the last in the cycle fourth quadra or \"delta\". Its perception of the world is harsh and realistic. It best relates to the element of earth. This quadra consists of the following sociotypes: LSE, EII, SLI, IEE. Earth is the most conservative but at the same time the most fertile element. In general such is the atmosphere of the quadra which unites realists who value stability and proven traditions above all else. Among them differs Huxley who is able to get involved in the unusual but even he in general is oriented towards the other side of the common in search of sensations.",
							"Sociotypes of this quadra have the following values. Firstly +Fi () good, warm relationships. Psychological factor plays the vital role. Without ethical values of positive character (such as recognition of religion, individuality and everyone's uniqueness, non-interference into the inner world of a man, concrete humanism and etc.) the stability that they strongly support is hardly possible. The second value -Si() - the existence of good working conditions, lack of discomfort, unwillingness to change the existing order of things, exclusion of harmful influence of the environment - in short to minimize negative sensations. In this quadra one can't work in a rush, comfort of the working place and coherence of the collective is highly valued. Most important place given to ecology and clean products.",
							"Thirdly the fourth quadra is oriented towards the aspect of +Te() which implies the logic of the use and management of the resources. This is the most cost-conscious quadra which is able to efficiently consume and prefers high quality and sturdy products. For sociotypes of this quadra risk, rush, economic chaos and fraud are unusual. Society of qualitative consumption can only be stable.",
							"And the fourth value of the quadra is -Ne() aspect meaning the alternative, unusual and sensational. Despite their grounded nature sociotypes of this quadra respect unusual and talented people who offer alternatives. In any case obstacles for the spread of new information no matter how avant-garde is not valued. Therefore in the community located on the fourth quadra stage periodically break out some sensations, outbreaks of interest towards original people and what they preach, alternative ideas for development are pushed forward.",
							"Social mission of \"delta\" quadra therefore is to ensure the stable development and judicious use of accumulated resources while preparing the ground for the weak seeds of new. Main quality of such societies (this includes most of the Western countries) is stable use of material and spiritual products. Only in conditions of stability can exist the development and spread of new and still very fragile and unprotected initiatives, beginnings, movements. In history of Russia such stable periods include for example the reign of Catherine II during which the \"golden age\" of Russian nobility happened. Or the industrial boom in Russia at the beginning of the XX century before the First World War. Psychological age of the quadra is old age. It has to bear the fading, torpor and relief. Wisdom and experience accompanies the last period of life that lies on the basis of respect for tradition and a significant proportion of conservatism which is so characteristic for sociotypes included in this quadra. Their time of year is Winter, which they meet not with empty hands.",
							"Stability for all its positive qualities also means a gradual stop of life. Absolutely stable systems can not endure for long as by law of entropy they decompose and degrade. But life is prolonged as during this period the search for alternative ways ends - finally forms and spreads the new trends that offer new paths of social development that reject traditional ones. One of these trends starts to rapidly grow namely that in which decrepit society needs most for the new revival. A new triumphal march begins - after winter comes the new spring. In the depths of the fourth quadra inevitably unfolds and proceeds to action the first one. The entire development cycle is repeated. That is how the complex mechanism of humanity works which we call the law of social progress. While quadras are socio-psychological units that determine the chronology of this process.”"

They are always driven towards all different directions, living in wait of some new and interesting information wherever it may come from. They are very entertaining people who prefer an environment with informal communication. They are democratic by nature, denying any stiffness or over-regulation. These sociotypes are almost completely torn off from the ground and easily move to any branch of human activity. Narrow specialization is not for them. While in continuous search, they can become the center of the nascent vortex - a source of future storms. But they do not carry the storm themselves. The most \"stormy\" on sight seems to be Robespierre but in real life he is a soft and compliant person who only in his dreams creates projects of a fair state.",
							"Sociotypes of the first quadra when discussing emerging issues rely on their common values. Firstly it is -Fe () i.e. minimization of negative emotions. Avoidance of quarrels and scandals, emotional instability seems more important overall for this quadra than getting positive emotional outbursts. Secondly it is +Si() i.e. positive sensations, comfort. In an atmosphere of tension and strictness they are unable to fully realize themselves. Their style of work is characterized by relaxation, freedom, comfort. Relationship with external environment in which their activity takes place must be friendly and pleasant. Their company is always comfortable, relaxed, homelike. It is never rude or eccentric.",
							"Third value is +Ne() - perspective ideas. Therefore in the \"air\" quadra there are always talks about the future, the unknown, the possible. These sociotypes might seem as hopeless dreamers. And that is totally true: They tend to look further than anyone else - over the horizon, with pleasure they push for and discuss \"crazy\" theories. Some of those theories however are destined to live long. So long that they always outlive their creators.",
							"The fourth value of this quadra - global structural logic -Ti(). The tool that they always use in getting to know the world is a systematic analysis. They are primarily interested in the universal laws that govern the world. And all the traditions, conventions and limitations are dropped when doing this. Literally everything is subject for comparison, analysis and analogies. The main objective that they pursue is a comprehensive, breathtaking in its vastness and harmony unified view of the world. The idea of integrity, rationality and justice of all things permeates through their worldview.",
							"First quadra also has a social mission with coincides with its values. Its purpose is creation and spread of new concepts of social development. In short it could be called enlightenment. In places where such sociotypes gather new social, scientific and political trends are always born and spread that may in the future change the course of history.",
							"Psychological \"age\" in which representatives of the first quadra live is childhood. All of them feel and often act like real kids - sincere, direct and greatly curious. They are able to be surprised by everything. Their skepticism is minimal. These \"child-like\" traditions will stay with them for all their life. Their undying thirst for new perspectives and open-minded, uncomplicated view of the world allows us to compared this phase of development to the first season of the year cycle - spring. It is in spring that new life energy wakes and makes everyone know of itself. Spring is a time of hopes and ambitious plans that will come true totally not as planned.”"

This quadra's perception is like water - a cleansed beginning. With its flow it washes away all of the dirt that has accumulated in the second stage. Simultaneously it starts to erode the foundation upon which the solid structure of second quadra was built. Water spreads over the surface filling cavities and cracks. Likewise the nature of the third quadra is characterized by variability, hidden reefs, inner wildness, hidden excitement, currents that are invisible from above.",
							"The third quadra professes its values. Firstly they refer to +Fi (). This aspect implies criticism of evil, desire to get away from bad people and negative relationships, protect themselves from enemies and adversaries. They want to minimize the negative experiences because all of the repressed issues as we know from psychoanalysis have to have an emotional response, physical payment for the purification of the subconscious.",

Suppressing their inner turmoil and short temper these sociotypes prefer a gradual move into the future though sharply rejecting outdated ideas and criticizing past mistakes and errors. Step by step closing by to the close, real future they generally believe in a linearity of development i.e. in their mind you just need to remove hindering obstacles, vestiges of the past and immediately in front of us opens up unlimited opportunities for growth. This quadra is not afraid of chaos and upheaval, they are able to act in situations of debacle, risk and confusion.",

This aspect stands higher than accumulation and rational consumption. Sociotypes of third quadra can successfully operate in conditions of economic scarcity when you need have to find a way out by using what might seem as useless at first but is available in abundance.",
							"Finally the sensory value of the quadra +Se() - resistance and opposition. This quality suggests that sociotypes of the quadra are able well to defend themselves and their positions. It is difficult for them to come to power as you have to resist the willful \"beta\" quadra but when they seize power they successfully keep it in spite of all attempts at restoring it. Security, ability to resist, not letting go of what is achieved is a principle that they respect. From these values naturally emerges social mission of the third quadra - cleansing which is to be understood both literally and figuratively. They restore outrageous or subject to distortion principles, doing everything in their power to remove obstacles and limitation preventing rapid improvement. Third quadra can be called a quadra of criticism and reform. In contrast to the \"fire\" quadra which is firstly oriented politically the \"water\" quadra is oriented socially.",
							"Third quadra is older than the second also by its psychological age. Its period - mid-life, maturity. It is no secret that exactly when reaching the middle of one’s life a person thinks deeply about how he lived before and by abandoning old stereotypes is able to drastically change the course of their destiny. Reflection on the journey from the heights of past years, evaluation of gained experience, collection of \"harvest\" corresponds essentially to fall - the time of the year when everyone can see how he worked during the spring and summer and what he objectively is worth. Fall - time of summing up and making evaluations.”"

Representatives of this style are Sociotypes EIE, ILI, LSE, SEI. As Dynamics, these types synthesize associational images. As Evolutionary types, they increase deductive complexity of them. As Negativists, they work well with contradictions and paradoxes.",
							"Intellectual Sphere",
							"The essential distinguishing feature of the Dialectical style, is a view of the universe as a unified struggle of opposites. In speech it often uses syntactic constructions \"if-then-else\", the predictive branches of a developing process. Within limits, the Dialectic strives to find an intermediate point of dynamic equilibrium between contrasting extremes. Dialectical cognition is born from the colliding flow and counterflow of thought, the consciousness and unconsciousness. Thinkers of this style are characterized by an express inclination towards the synthesis of opposites, the removal of contradictions, which they so keenly perceive.",
							"Its advantages are obvious: it is the most subtle and flexible style. It can easily switch to an opposite direction, and possesses predictive ability, accompanied by an effective type of associative memory. Algorithmic thinking is also good at solving problems of classification, given their gift for recognizing complex patterns. Beyond the circumstantial conditions of a problem, it perceives a fundamental algorithm for its solution.",
							"According to Aristotle, Dialecticals prognostic thinking explains reality on the basis of purposive causes. For example, the cause of a sculpture is an idea of it in the head of the sculptor. The main role is played by a program, the intention of the creator. Thus, it can be considered teleological, and hence the most 'religious' in its essential thinking. Many scholars of this type sooner or later come to faith (not necessarily a church confessional).",
							"Social Sphere",
							"Historically, the first representative of a Dialectical worldview would be Heraclitus. Epitomizing the Dynamic dichotomy, he was of the opinion that \"you cannot enter the same river twice\" because whenever you enter again, the flow is already of different water. In more recent times it developed into Hegel's comprehensive theory of a rational system. Since Dialectical cognition, compared to other styles, is the most oriented towards creative intention, it invariably leads to ideas of a creator, an absolute, a cosmic intelligence, etc.",
							"Two of its representatives—EIE and ILI—are usually recognized in society as the most intellectual types. They form the backbone of intellectual elites, expert clubs, esoteric groups, etc. They are the best computer programmers, knowing better than other types how to work with moving structures—algorithms. Algorithmic diagrams consist of blocks and arrows showing the order of transitions, branches, and loop cycles. The crux of a program is its dynamic structure—pointers, rather than blocks. The formula \"if-then-else\" is, in essence, the core of any algorithm.",
							"The disadvantages in Dialectical-Algorithmic cognition include instability and uncertainty. Algorithmics suffer from difficulty in making choices and embracing unambiguous decisions. This thinking is more comparable to a symphony of flowing interwoven imagery, rather than a mechanism of clearly established instruction sets. Another problem is increased criticality, which can be so high that it incurs self-destruction, plunging them into danger of total detachment from reality, and leading to mental disorders, especially in cases of hereditary predisposition.",
							"Psychological Sphere",
							"The psyche of Dialectical types is most prone to transformations. From a psychological point of view, an unstable oscillating psyche is fertile ground for suggestibility. Occasionally Dialectics lose control over the parallel streams of thought fluctuating in their heads. They need only tune out their internal oscillation between freedom of choice and fatalism, and reinforce the latter. Doctors know that a small but accurately timed shock can throw the heart into a state of fibrillation. Likewise, a successfully directed signal at the right time can throw the Dialectical psyche into a chaotic state.",
							"The EIE Sociotype has a very suitable psyche for suggestive influence. It is characterized by so-called moments of imprint vulnerability. In these moments an intense suggestion is triggered—an imprint—the prerequisites of which are a state of extreme fear, confusion, or surprise. A 'No Exit' sign suddenly seen by a person of Algorithmic psyche at a time of severe emotional turmoil, may catalyze a decision about suicide. Exploiting this paradoxical nature of Dialectical types, shock therapy is capable of completely reprogramming their conception of reality, including core value judgments.",
							"A certain, although rare sign of Dialectical cognition—accidents that lead to states similar to a deep trance or coma, followed by sudden enlightenment or the appearance of esoteric abilities.",
							"The other version is slow suggestion, primarily based on entrainment through rhythmic vocalization and/or sound, multiple repetitions of the same phrase with variation. Variations in this case are particularly significant, working akin to the chorus in a song. Gradually a trance state is reached—external relaxation with internal concentration. The greater the monotony, the sooner a deep trance is reached. Hence why some people rapidly settle down and fall asleep under a monotone 'bubnezh' TV.",
							"Scientific Sphere",
							"Dialectical thinking best corresponds to the quantum-probabilistic worldview of modern physics. According to this paradigm, there are no immutable laws, only tendencies and probabilities. Quantum Mechanics is built on the counterintuitive principle of particle-wave duality, according to which microcosmic objects behave as particles and as waves. Two of the 20th century's greatest physicists disputed over this view—Albert Einstein and Neils Bohr. The former defended causal-determinism as the nature of the universe, the latter advocated a probabilistic ontology. In the aftermath, Bohr won. Though apart from its historical context, the dispute makes little sense, given that these cognitive forms are dual to one other. Jung's principle of 'synchronicity' also lies within the Dialectical paradigm.",
							"Contemporary British mathematician Roger Penrose has suggested that the human brain uses quantum gravity as a means for intuitive insight. He's written several books (\"The Emperor's New Mind\" and \"Shadows of the Mind\") stipulating that the brain is a quantum computer, and that Aristotelian logical thinking is actually alien to human beings. If he is right, it follows that the integral type of humanity is Dialectical-Algorithmic.",
							"A real-life model of this thinking—double-images periodically passing into each other. Simple example: a projection onto the plane of a truncated pyramid. After examining it awhile it alternately seems convex, with the top facing to the observer, then concave, with the rear wall receding into the distance.",
							"One more graphical illustration of Dialectical perception. What do you see in the picture: a vase against a black background, or two facial profiles on a white background? It depends on which one for you is the background, and which is the figure. Some see a vase and the profiles turn into a dark background, others see two black profiles and the white vase goes into the background. But once a person sees both images, fluctuations of attention begin. The picture seems to pulsate: you see a vase, then the profiles. There is a dialectical exchange of background/foreground. Triggering negative reverse perspective, where distant or darkened objects are perceived more significantly than those located closer to the observer."

							"“The fourth cognitive style: it is synthetic, positive, and inductive. Its most appropriate title is Vortical-Synergetic. This form flows in Sociotypes ESE, SLI, LIE, IEI. Synergetics—the science of how order emerges from chaos. The word 'synergy' in Ancient Greek means \"concerted action\". The concept of synergy continues to be discussed at present. In the West, it is called 'Chaos Theory' or 'Nonlinear Dynamics' [9]. For our purposes, it is important to note that it is characterized by so-called dissipative states—non-equilibrium, nonlinear, unstable. As Dynamics, Synergetics think fluidly with tints of one thought cascading into another. As Positivists, they converge towards a point of attraction. As Involutionary types, they frequently turn backwards and jump over previous levels, displacing the flow of their thoughts like a vortex or fluctuating storm. IEI as if in a kaleidoscope sees whimsical iridescent imagery, dissolving then receding in flux. LIE thinks very experimentally with many variants rapidly assorted and mentally tested on the fly for practical applicability. ESE initiates a social torrent leaving behind a trail of emotional turbulence. Thoughts 'swarm' and chaotically displace one another. SLI 'lies in a drift' as it were awaiting favorable wind. Once the situation becomes favorable, self-organization immediately takes hold and rapid thinking initiates, scrolling through incoming information, identifying options most and least likely to succeed.",
							"Intellectual Sphere",
							"Characteristic of a 'vortex' is its self-organizing nature, moving like a whirlwind. This manifests mentally as a rapid search for options, tests, and the subsequent screening of variants which do not yield results. It operates on basis of testing, advancing to the goal through trial and error. In a sense, it is comparable to a perpetual lab experiment in the brain.",
							"The first advantage of Vortical cognition—liveliness and naturalness. It seems to simulate the actual processes occurring in nature. Another advantage—faith in success and luck. Synergetics do not confuse temporary setbacks with error; they will undertake attempt after attempt until success ultimately comes to them.",
							"Its chief disadvantage is that the intellectual search is often blind and uneconomical. Another difficulty is its randomness and spontaneity. Synergetic intellect is a kind of chain reaction that catalyzes itself. The mechanism of positive feedback operates: if not curbed, then the concentration of effort first leads to an explosion, followed by dissipation.",
							"Synergetic intellect explains phenomena through substantive reasoning. The very substance (material or substrate) itself generating phenomena through natural movement. In the Aristotle example, the cause of sculpture is the block of marble from which it was made.",
							"Social Sphere",
							"Vortical cognition developed into a unique intellectual paradigm that was deemed later than all others to have social merit, despite it being most akin to natural phenomena. It is known that in natural conditions, all processes run in cycles. For example, in laissez-faire economies operating on Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' principle, natural cyclical fluctuations in market supply and demand guide the natural equilibrium prices of goods.",
							"Studying biological evolution, Charles Darwin discovered its origin as a struggle for existence against natural selection, and survival of the fittest organisms. The main engine of this 'evolution', is involution through events of random variation, which abruptly leave no intermediate gradual links between appearances of species.",
							"Biological self-organization is catalyzed by mutation—sudden, unpredictable changes in genetic material. Involution generates pulsating chaos, as evolution simultaneously selects and propagates useful mutations.",
							"Following in the involutionary trend of Darwinism, the concept of 'punctuated equilibrium' emphasizes the discontinuous development of species observed in nature. Authors Gould and Eldridge conclude from this fact that smooth gradual evolution of species is impossible under natural conditions. To survive, all organs must simultaneously be in working order; there are no creatures present with half-fin wings, half-hoof toes, etc. According to this theory, the lifetime of a species is divided into two unequal stages of duration. The first stage is stasis, long periods where no significant species change occurs. Then the second stage, a time of fracture when the species is rapidly converted into another form, or dies out.",
							"In the 20th century, as I mentioned, the vortex idea was rediscovered and Synergetics adopted its armament. The motto of Synergetics—order through fluctuation. Such fluctuations (local perturbations in the system) are analogous to biological mutation. Order in the chaotic evolution of complex socio-psychological systems, Socionics understands through the law of quadra progression. However, we must not forget that in the irreversible progression of quadras is a series of involutional junctures—jumps, twists, and turns. Because of this, the real non-theoretical quadra progression curve is jagged and looped, its outline resembling the dancing tongues of a burning flame.",
							"Psychological Sphere",
							"This cognitive style imbues qualities of endurance and optimism to the psyche. However, the psyche of Synergetics is less stable than that of Holographers. Synergetic types are partially conditionable, but capable of discarding undesired habits. For restoration of normal mental life they need specific, and sometimes long periods of trial and error. Depriving their life of continuous forward movement exerts a bad effect upon their mind. Operating principle: As ambient momentum of circumstance declines, their self-determination atrophies. Lack of oncoming circumstantial pressures renders them increasingly worse off.",
							"The best countermeasure in such situations is positive self-programming. Consisting of forcing disturbing thoughts to the background and dissolving them in positive scenarios. IEI before sleep visualizes a pleasant scene to remove disturbing experiences of the day. LIE casts a desirable goal in its imagination, optimistic it will eventually acquire the necessary persons and resources. ESE simply does not think about past mistakes and its mood is improved by itself. SLI is not the first place puts a positive scenario and awaits the moment possible to implement it.",
							"It is often forgotten that the synergetic aspect of development makes extended forecasts futile. American meteorologist Edward Lorenz descriptively coined this phenomenon the 'Butterfly Effect'. Where a butterfly waving its wings in some part of America can, with specific confluence of circumstances, induce a hurricane somewhere in Indonesia. Complex nonlinear phenomena are unpredictable, because tiny initial influences with time can lead to enormous consequences. In conventional life, this same phenomenon is called the Domino Effect. Where the initial fall of the first domino successfully entails catastrophe of the series. The catalyzing action, whose event occurs on your will, determines which of the scenarios will run—optimistic or pessimistic.",
							"Scientific Sphere",
							"This cognitive form reflects the synergy formed by the current worldview. Within this paradigm during the 18th century arose the Kant-Laplace hypothesis about the vortex origin of the sun and planets from cosmic dust.",
							"The Synergetic paradigm is opposed to Creationism; the emergence of complex systems explains spontaneous creation, not divine intervention. A typical example from the history of science is biochemist A. I. Oparin's hypothesis on the emergence of life from inanimate matter in the primordial 'broth' of Earth's early existence, which was largely confirmed in Stanley Miller's famous 1953 experiment.",
							"Also hailing from the Synergetic paradigm comes the outlook of Nikolai Amosov. According to him it \"explains the evolution of the world's self-organizing structures… miracles can happen, but are of no practical value.\" He sincerely believes demonstrative simulations can be recreated by computer models.",
							"Synergetics recognize the critical role of chance and free will in transitional moments of history. Synergetically-minded scholars frequently consider alternative historical outcomes. British historian Arnold J. Toynbee in particular, explored this twist on the course of ancient history—what if Alexander of Macedon did not die (pessimistic version), how would the world have developed then (optimistic version)?",
							"A real-life model of Synergetic cognition is the turbulent flow. Turbulence is a liquid or gas flow, in which there is rapid mixing of its moving layers. The behavior of such flows cannot be predicted. Whereas the preceding laminar flow phrase exhibits clear regularities deducible by Causal-Determinism.",
							"Mathematical modeling of natural growth processes typically uses exponential functions. Such functions describe geometric progressions, rather than arithmetic values. Logarithmic (S-shaped) curves terminating in saturation points are common in dynamic modeling. Implying that self-organization is not omnipotent: after exceeding a certain limit, it exhausts its own momentum. At which point it becomes necessary to either yield to external structure, or create a new nexus of self-organization. Synergetic types naturally select the latter.",
							"Lev N. Gumilev offers a Synergetic account for involutions of ethnogenesis in the birth, growth, and death process of societies. Social systems dictate rules of selection for specific behaviors of people. Charismatic-personalities (cranks, outcasts, dissenters) engender a variety of diverse social mutations. Society holds them at bay, until such time that it weakens for any reason (due to economic crisis, internal wars, cultural stagnation, etc.). Afterwards, the energy of a new order vigorously sweeps the decrepit system and begins to grow in its place. But sooner or later, the new order itself will age just the same and be forced to give way to an alternative system ripening in its depths, and so forth.",
							"Vortical cognition is hardest to convey to people of Algorithmic cognition, since to them free choice and the game of chance opposes teleology, fate, the special role of a creator, etc. When Synergetics speak about the implicit order in chaos, if we translate their words to the language of Socionics, they imply that Holographical cognition, with its minimally convoluted ordering structures, is dual to the chaotic vortex."

'Holograph' originates from the Ancient Greek words holos \"entire, whole\" and grapho \"write\". This name is derived from the Holographist's ability to densely pack information via method of 'like to, similar' analogy. Sociotypes possessing this form are SLE, LII, IEE, ESI. As Statics, Holographers attain reliable precision of thought. As Negativists they periodically turn the object of thought to its opposite side. As Involutionary types, they sporadically change the angle of examination or criterion of judgment.",
							"Intellectual Sphere",
							"This cognitive style has much in common with the holographic principle in physics. A hologram (optical) is a statistically recorded interference pattern made by two beams of light which are transmitted and reflected from a single source. Holographic technology allows us to obtain a three-dimensional image of an object. The hologram itself is an aggregation of stripes and spots exactly resembling the embedded object. The two beams of light are superimposed in such a way that every part of the hologram carries information about the whole.",
							"In this way, by mentally superimposing multiple projections of the same object, Holographists reach a holistic view. To do this, they look at the image and select a desired angle of examination. Holographic cognition often utilizes the grammatical conjunctions: \"or-or\", \"either-or\", \"on the one hand, on the other hand\". It actively uses the principle of perspective; unrestricted choice in point of view. The holographic approach is a progressive approximation towards the purpose, or away from it, accompanied by changes of perspective. The holographic process is carried out as if calibrating focus.",
							"Holographic cognition has a characteristic penetrating, skeletal-revealing, 'x-ray' nature. It unhesitatingly cuts away details and nuances, giving a coarsely generalized representation of the subject. Take for example the two orthogonal cross-sections of a cylinder: the horizontal section looks like a circle, and the vertical section looks like a rectangle. Two different perspectives of an indivisible whole which, when superimposed in the mind, produces transition to a higher level of understanding about the object.",
							"SLE thinks this way in battle. Analyzing the situation, they simplify it to two or three facets (frontal, flank, and/or rear), but then quickly go to a higher tier of understanding. LII grasps the problem from opposite sides, mentally rotating the situation in three dimensions around its semantic axes. ESI first draws near to a person, then moves away, seeming to probe the individual from all sides, cutting off those who could let them down. IEE detects the possible hidden motivations of a person, as if building their psychological 'hologram'.",
							"The main advantages of Holographic cognition are as follows. First, it is multi-perspective. As already stated, because of this it attains a dimensionally holistic and complete depiction. Second, it values simplicity and clarity, avoids pretentiousness, and forgoes 'bells and whistles'. Holographists are particularly effective in crisis situations, when it is necessary to make decisions quickly, and there is no time to weigh all the details.",
							"The obvious disadvantage of this cognitive style is that it appears too rough, lacking adequate consideration to details which become important when a process flows smoothly. Its information-dense constructs are often difficult to decompress and unpack; to outsiders, they may seem void of intermediate links for establishing coherency in their connections.",
							"According to Aristotle, Holographic cognition corresponds to explanation by structural or formative causes. Aristotle called it the structure of form. Returning to the sculptor example, the cause of the sculpture is its latent form, which the sculptor merely sets free by cutting away excess marble.",
							"Social Sphere",
							"A vague idea of the holographic concept was expressed by Gottfried Leibniz's \"Monadology\". His monad, a microcosmic reflection of the whole world order, is analogous to a hologram. Ecologists regularly turned to it in attempting to understand why there is stability in nature. Relationships between living and non-living nature arising in a given territory causes biogeocenosis, or ecosystem formation. Ecosystems are primarily characterized by equilibrium of self-similarity over time, where long-term coexistence of opposites without merging (synthesis) is observed. Therefore, Static prevails over Dynamic in such communities. Therein lies the fundamental law of homeostasis in the ecosystem.",
							"General systems theory was later formed on the basis of these ideas. It was founded by Austrian biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy, who introduced the concept of open systems, which exchange matter, energy, and information with the environment, thus resisting destabilization.",
							"While Determinists attempt to explain the behavior of a system by its component parts and interconnections, Holographists find novel qualities illustrating emergent features in it that cannot be accounted for solely from its internal structure. Therefore, the Holographical paradigm can generally be called a systemic-ecological worldview.",
							"Contemporary 'green' ideology is an epitomization of this cognitive form. This does not in any way imply that the ideologues of this movement are Holographical types—cognitive styles and proclaimed viewpoints may not necessarily coincide! Manifestations of one cognitive style through another are completely typical. The books of \"quantum psychologist\" Robert Anton Wilson are a good example of this, in which his Dialectical-Algorithmic form is laden with multi-perspective, holographic content [5].",
							"Psychological Sphere",
							"Holographical cognition corresponds to a stable, self-possessed psyche resistant to conditioning. In comparing the conditionability of an LSI psyche to its Involutionary Mirror SLE, observation shows that the degree of psychological resistance is much higher in the latter. How is this explained? By the durable cognitive infrastructure on which it is built. Complete panorama, which allows periodic change of perspective on the subject. Good balance between the immune and nervous systems, as well as the primary sense organs.",
							"In neuro-linguistic programming, this principle is used in a technique called 'reframing'. Reframing changes the perceptual framework contextualizing an event. If we mentally place a familiar object into an unfamiliar context, then significance of the whole situation changes. For example, imagine a tiger first in a jungle, then in a zoo cage, then on the balcony of your apartment. The standard Socionics type is depicted as immersed in its 'club'. But what if you shift it to quadra? What if it turns out to be among types with opposite cognitive styles? The chain can continue indefinitely.",
							"With reframing it is possible to see the familiar with fresh eyes. The type of the psyche in one who resorts to this technique remains constant of course, only their subjective relation to the object of attention is changed. The benefit of this method is primarily in the fact that new perspectives emphasize aspects of a situation that may have been previously underestimated, allowing the possibility of discovering new avenues of growth, and expanding one's existing range of choices.",
							"Scientific Sphere",
							"A real-life physical model of this multi-perspective intellect is the hologram—a superimposition of multiple images where each one can only be seen when looking at a certain angle. Change of perspective occurs intermittently and does not alter the system itself, only its priorities. In this way, multiple standards can be implemented, making it possible to work with a complex system as if it were a simple sequence.",
							"Another real-life prototype of Holographical cognition are fractal objects, discovered by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in the 1970s. Geometrically, fractals are figures with diffuse outlines, possessing self-similar internal structures. For example, trees, snowflakes, coastlines, etc. They are characterized by multiple internal forms similar in principle to nesting-dolls. Like a hologram, any fragment of a fractal contains complete information about the entire fractal. The part is always structurally similar to the whole.",
							"Socionics types are also like fractal objects. Hence my holographic concept of personality as a nested system of types, one inside another [4]. Which opposes the prevailing flat view of Socionics advocated by people with reductionist thinking."

As Positivists, they aim towards singularly valid solutions.",
							"Intellectual Sphere",
							"Causal-Determinist cognition is known under synonymous names as formal logic or deterministic thinking, both of which emphasize its rigid nature. Speech in this cognitive style takes shape with aid of the connectives \"because\", \"therefore\", \"consequently\" (causal conjunctions). The mental process consists in constructing chains of cause and effect, reducing explanations to deterministic mechanisms. Using the example of Aristotle, who first pointed out four ways to explain phenomena, the reason for the existence of a sculpture is the sculptor who fashioned it directly.",
							"In the scientific sphere so thinks ILE, in the managerial-administrative sphere is methodical LSI, in the social sphere SEE calculates chains of material interests, in the humanitarian sphere subject to the same categorical imperative is EII.",
							"Social Sphere",
							"Aristotle is considered the discoverer of this approach. The basic laws of formal thinking are outlined in his theory of syllogism. However, the first to consistently put them into practice was Euclid, founder of geometry. More recently, its principles grounded rationalist Rene Descartes in his 1637 treatise \"Discourse on the Method\". Then it finally took shape in mathematical logic. The Causal-Determinist paradigm reached its apogee in Logical Positivism, then increasingly began to decline in value towards the end of the 20th century. However, as the common stereotype of proof, it still dominates to this day.",
							"I will touch its advantages. First, it is perceived by society as the most authoritative, most convincing, and singularly correct. In mathematics, it is formalized as the deductive-axiomatic method. Use of it requires great intellectual stamina. Second, attributes of greater clarity and concentration are inherent to this style. The type most characterized by singular concentration is LSI. However, the irrational SEE argues quite soundly, deriving one consequence from another, implying focus on the chain of events. If even one link fails for any reason, then Determinists lose their sense of rationale and find it difficult to act because they see no reason to.",
							"At the same time, Causal-Determinism has its drawbacks. It is primarily the most artificial and removed from the laws of functioning life. Its efficacy extends to the 'logical' formulation of already existing results, the construction of operating mechanisms, but not fundamentally new discoveries. The first dead end which formalization risks is scholasticism, i.e. pointless albeit logically impeccable reasoning. The second intellectual dead end faced by sequential Determinists is the trap of reductionism, which they fall into on account of fragmenting wholes into their component parts. This deficiency was noted even by the ancient skeptics, as well as in modern times by Hume, who doubted that any event could be dictated by strict reason.",
							"Indeed, in building a long chain of cause and effect, it is difficult to avoid the danger of circularity, the risk of falling into circulus vitiosus—a vicious circle in the proof. Kurt Gödel's theorem on the incompleteness of formal systems, asserts that any sufficiently complex system of rules is either inconsistent, or contains conclusions that can be neither proven nor refuted by the rules of that system. This established limits in the applicability of formal logic. Using the deductive-axiomatic method, the medieval Scholastics in particular, attempted to rigorously prove the existence of God. Resulting from closure of causes in terms of effects, they circularly arrived at a definition of God as the thought which thinks of itself.",
							"Psychological Sphere",
							"Causal-Determinist cognition forges a mentality poorly protected from indoctrination, or in extreme cases, even brainwashing. By skillfully combining memorable words and actions, it is possible to gain control over the behavior of specific individuals. Intelligent Determinists in particular, are characterized by a strong dependence on the events of childhood, which Sigmund Freud discovered in his time, though poorly understood in full. Habits in pronounced Determinists are comparable in their rigidity to conditioned reflexes.",
							"Standard military interrogation procedures are designed to ensure guaranteed cause-effect impacts upon the psyche. It includes measures of exposure such as sleep deprivation, changes in room temperature and/or humidity, denial of food subsequently followed by its delivery as a reward, etc. Isolation of the detainee and the gradual imposition of regulations, bears fruit sooner or later. In time, the vulnerability of psychological destabilization is manufactured into dependence upon the interrogator.",
							"It is noteworthy that extreme critical situations, trigger a 'slow-motion film' state of mind in Determinists. Thinking becomes particularly clear, but stretched out over time, such that seconds can subjectively feel like minutes. Along these same lines, due to an abrupt shakeup of their psyche, the stress of surprise severely impedes their cerebral activity until they can recover in deep sleep.",
							"The psychological school of Behaviorism represents this model of the psyche. Its supporters believe that behavioral learning is achieved through reinforcement—rewarding adherence to rules and punishing their violation. B. F. Skinner formulated the principle of operant conditioning, according to which the behavior of living organisms is completely determined by the cause-effect of this conditioning. He proposed the method of 'successive approximations', in which students receive positive reinforcement in instances where their behavior conforms to that desired.",
							"Behaviorists developed the concept of conditioned learning and established a rigid procedural method of action towards the goal as the basis for its operation.",
							"Scientific Sphere",
							"Formal logical thinking in its time gave birth to the deterministic cause-effect worldview. This is the worldview of classical physics whose cornerstone is Newtonian Mechanics, and was the dominant paradigm until the early 20th century. Rigid systems operate according to these rules—organisms and mechanisms. When faced with multi-factor processes (such as psychology or society), however, reductionism loses its explanatory power to portray complex phenomena in terms of their basic components. Additionally, this classic paradigm has been too influenced by the ideal of 'progress', in spite of numerous historical examples of regressive tendencies, setbacks, repetitions, etc.",
							"A real-life model of Causal-Determinist cognition is given by information represented in the form of a chart or realistic illustration made using a direct perspective. In this technique, objects are depicted larger or smaller in proportion to their distance from the observer. By drawing in this way, following strict instructions, any object can be easily depicted."

From this standpoint we can understand the paradox when a Pragmatist may be among those who get behind (he simply does not understand why he needs all these abstract rules and formulas), but after school he becomes quite successful. The problem is that the school focused on mechanic learning of theoretical knowledge cannot understand usefulness of his practical skills. The third problem is caused by their strive for concrete values – for this reason they strive for being “authoritative”, and often interpret advice from others (even constructive) as an infringement on their authority.”"

The combination of the squares does not occur, that is, each relationship does not appear individually. In joint actions, each has its own role and responsibilities. Mutual aid Misunderstandings, if they arise, are resolved quickly. The atmosphere is businesslike, even jokes have a business tone.

							"“Consider what is happening MI based on the model \"A\". Shechter and Kobrinskaya write that in the group “the atmosphere is businesslike, even business jokes”, which is generally predictable. After all, all the functions of the vital block and the superego block of any member of the group are represented in the leading blocks of other TIMs. In other words, any member of this group is “driven” into its “Ego” block, because all positions except the “Ego” block are “occupied”. A person cannot express himself fairly freely in any of the functions of the contact block, except for the creative one, since enters into competition with someone from the group. By the nature of the interaction, this group very much resembles Group 2 “Locks” or “Equilibrium”. If we proceed from the nature of intertype relationships (AI), we can assume the following. The interaction with the activator will be the most intense, while the instability of the activation relationship will be enhanced by the quasi-identity relationship, and the superego will not stabilize the group and provide the necessary support. Continuing the course of reasoning, we can note the following. The authors write that the participants \"were simply offered communication for approximately 20-30 minutes.\" And further, \"in joint actions, each has its own role and responsibilities.\" It is not at all clear what the group members did after all, just communicated or performed joint actions, and if the latter, how did they manage to find topics for discussion in a given time, find a common language, agree on joint actions, and produce these actions. With what speed should all the above described happen? “After some time (for members of the group, author) there is a need for rest, because the intensity of communication is great. \" Most likely, the interaction in the group did not go beyond communication. In their work, Schechter and Kobrinskaya call this group \"mobilization.\" Meanwhile, in the description of group effects there is not a hint of mobilization, in contrast to the group described by them as the “progress ring” or “quadra”, where there is a “feeling of recovery, mobilization” [6]. Conclusion: it is clear that the name of the group does not reflect the essence of the intragroup effect, joint activity, if it is not episodic in nature, is difficult, the group requires further study due to the inconsistency of the described group effects.”"

The reason that this happens is that one shares Asking/Declaring, Positivist/Negativist and Rational/Irrational with the Semi-Dual and Mirage, and changing one's pole in those dichotomies costs too much energy to sustain. \"Club Displacement\" is my name for this. It is possible to have brief shifts to the Beneficiary and Benefactor, for example, but since they differ in Rationality and Positivist/Negativist, it can't be sustained. To use my own type as an example: ILI's are naturally Researchers (Intuitive/Logical). However, when ILI's have to work in a Pragmatist field (Sensing/Logical), then it is natural for them to take up the authoritarian, centralized methods of a Marshal (SLE), finding weakness and eliminating them. Similarly, when ILI's work in a Humanitarian (Intuitive/Ethical) field, it is natural for them to turn the commonplace upside down and advise people out of difficult life situations like an IEE.

They rely on the well-known principle of \"dominoes\": one knuckle fallen down pushes the other until the whole chain falls. Therefore, behaviorally, they are always ready for the most likely event. As the reader was convinced, here I am somewhat narrowing the meaning of the concept of “associativity”, putting into it approximately the same content as J. Grinder and R. Bendler put into the concept of “anchoring” [4], i.e. it means the combination of stimulus reactions of any nature.Mathematically, associativity is written as a “bracketed” operation - an arbitrary combination of terms or factors: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c). The sociotypes of this group have a large number of diverse ideas, but these ideas are poorly ordered, freely flowing one into another.”"

They perceive unevenly, as if through some glasses of traditionalism - an orderly experience, putting some objects or states to the forefront and pushing others away, which become just a background. Distributive psyche sets out ideas about the phenomena of the world in a certain order - it distributes them to the first, second, third, etc., depending on the depth of distribution. The first objects in such an orderly series are perceived clearly and concretely, the latter - as if they fall out of perception, few are taken into account. Distributive sociotypes are harder to tolerate uncertainty (equiprobability of outcomes), since they lose their foothold - the ability to distribute forces and means for a specific goal. Therefore, they strive to move as quickly as possible to a steady state — either to return to the old one, or to go back to the new. These are the most organized and punctual members of society, strictly meeting the time schedule and technological discipline. By virtue of these qualities, by their share in a team or social stratum, one can assess its stability and adherence to traditions. The things with which they surround themselves are smaller than those of the Commutative, but they are contained in a greater order. Mathematically, a distribution law can be written as a replacement for a product by a sum, that is, as an operation “opening the brackets”: a (b + c) = ab + ac. The common factor “a” is evenly distributed among all the terms, symbolically expressing a strongly cultivated tradition. Distributors unwittingly pass everything that is again perceived through their past experience - they think through eidetic images.”"

In other words, since all functions of the information metabolism are in the expert zone of its members, any information in the group is assessed adequately and is perceived in detail. Since there are no priorities and no avoiding - any information is valuable, I would call this group a “balance” group. The experience of communication in such a group confirms the justification of such a name. As a participant, the author happened to be in two such stable groups for a long time (from several hours to several days) under conditions of intensive interaction. The following information can be regarded as the author’s self-report, which does not contradict the opinion of two more members of one of the groups. Communication is easy, on an equal footing, any proposal is agreed, no one imposes his decisions. But at the same time, the group feels stiff, light tension because any proposal must pass the approval of all members of the group, although the group always came to a consensus. From the group there is a feeling of some awkwardness. This can be compared to a heavy pendulum. When someone in the equilibrium group makes a proposal for joint actions, before the group makes a decision, you have to wait until the whole system comes to equilibrium again. If the group begins to act, then it as a heavy flywheel cannot be quickly unwound and cannot be quickly stopped. The initial rise and enthusiasm from the meeting quickly gives way to a smooth relationship. There are no intellectual disputes in the group and no emotional support, even between duals. Communication is a dyad: repayment, superego, duals. There are no proposals for joint activities requiring any efforts, each member of the group understands that they should not do this. Because the initiatives will either not be supported or will require lengthy approvals, which is too energy-consuming. From communication in the group does not feel the energy recovery, the topics of communication are extremely superficial. At the same time, even prolonged communication does not bore you.”"

Despite their external stoicism, they always have poorly protected and vulnerable points and a need for a solid foundation. If this foundation is removed, they lose any resistance to stress they may have had. Stress threatens these types with challenging doubts and in the end leads them to break internally (\"giants with feet of clay\"). The defining element for their rational temperament is \"monolithism\". Taking into account that rationality is related to the orientation in time (planning, order) as well as to speech as communication forms, and that the right progress is much more rational than the left in nature, we conclude that this group of types is strongly dependent on the time factor and verbal signals. In dealing with these types one can observe that they have as if anchors in time, easily developed habits to do this or that action at specific points in time.

To develop a stable habit a single tie to a specific moment in time is not enough for them. For additional stability they use visual anchors.
