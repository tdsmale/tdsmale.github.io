Flatpacked, jungian, psuedo-scientific nonsense. A tree o' words!
I probably could have AI-generated this in a fraction of the time.
OH WELL.

		// TODO
		- each small group has 3 versions...expressed with two possible pairings. define them!
		- clean up large articles (headers)
		- header with:
			- contents button
			- dark/light mode
			- detailed tables mode
			- original socionics names mode
		- sources
		- never stop absorbing (michael pierce, jack oliver, lenore thomson, BOOKS.)
		- list small groups (including pair dichots) in each pair (should be 7 per pair, potentially 14 including pair dichots)
		- expand on polarities (i.e. separate descriptions for both positive & negative)
		- collapsible divs (per dichot, per tetra, per group) (i) (x) (+) (-)
		- replace popups with divs that expand underneath (need to put a div in every possible location, then programatically determine WHICH div to place content in...)
		- get rid of popup right header table, put elsewhere
		- hide pair types in popups more effectively (or better seperate from working groups)
		- figure out type/attitude picker (or at least make smaller on mobile)
		- test on many browsers & devices
		- finish all code label inputs (some are still blank)
		- socionics labels
		- upload
		- permanent links (get vars...)

In less extreme iterations also spiritual drawn toward a kind of animism belief, valuing nature and the life principle in all things. Advocating an expansion of our awareness of what is alive, and what is conscious. May swerve into certain beliefs like synchronicity, astrology, panpsychism, etc."

For them, conclusions are only the end trails of a long ancestry of Ti data-sorting. And so to explain any one point, the scholar often walks you through the entire deductive pathway, as a narrative. Prone to be dry.. TL;DR …but feeling that sharing anything less than the whole background material would make the conclusion less useful to others. Unlike the Ti+Ne types whose knowledge relies a bit more on pure deduction and “a priori”, their conclusions and philosophies are only supported through an elaborate material database and lead to very earthy, grounded answers… but answers one wouldn’t normally come to without going through such meticulous care."

Often interested in anthropology, and the customs of other cultures and people.

Tending toward concepts of universal acceptance, being ethical to your fellow man, but also freeing oneself of self-shame, letting the mind release worries and enter the stillness of Ni.

							"In general terms, this dichotomy refers to orientation towards either space (Static) or time (Dynamic). The categories of space and time are vital a priori concepts studied in detail by Immanuel Kant in “Critique of Pure Reason”, contrasting them as extent and duration.",
							"Statics depend more on space, Dynamics more on time. Filling space with objects characterizes Static behavior, whereas Dynamics saturate time with events. Statics cannot stand empty spacethey immediately fill it with available items on hand. Dynamics cannot stand empty timeboredom, stagnation, prolonged states of the same condition. In a certain sense, Statics can be called people of place, Dynamics people of time.",
							"Now consider this dichotomy on the individual levels of communication.",
							"Intellectual Level",
							"Statics tend towards fragmentary-analytic thinking; Dynamics tend towards associative-synthetic thinking.",
							"Analysis, as defined by most sources, is the division of a whole into clearly delimited parts. Analytical work is meant to delineate boundaries. Whereas synthesis is akin to associativity, i.e. the association of two or more concepts by fuzzy, rapid connections whereby one occurrence immediately evokes others to mind. Resulting in a coherent synthetic image with blurred internal boundaries.",
							"The epitomization of Dynamic cognition formed the explanatory basis for the nature of mental processes in the theory of associationism. Aristotle first advanced the idea that spontaneous mental images can converge so closely together that the similarity or contrast of multiple associations emerges on the basis of contiguity. Later John Locke argued that ideas of any degree of complexity emerge from the process of associating simple sensations. In this case he contrasted the association of ideas against purely semantic connections, which in his opinion were secondary.",
							"Indeed, eidetic mnemonic techniques showed that with aid of visual association, it is possible to connect anything in the mind. Here are some of the eidetic memory techniques originating in antiquity.",
							"Roman orator Cicero used the ‘method of loci' to memorize his speeches by heart. He mentally laid out information in the corners of a room, mentally returning to one corner or another to extract as required. Medieval Dominican monks studying rhetoric used the same method. They took a road familiar to them to the last detail and mentally walked down it, successively laying out along the road statements which would be presented before the audience. While speaking, they would mentally walk the route, ‘raising' key concepts they had previously laid there.",
							"Contemporary advertising cleverly exploits the Dynamic side of human cognition. It is mainly based on the mechanism of association by context (manly cowboy next to a pack of cigarettes) or contrast (ordinary laundry detergent vs. advertised laundry detergent). Judging by this means of consumer inducement, advertising presumably influences Statics much less than Dynamics. Statics memorize more effectively when material is structured in rigid semantic relationships, where each concept is fixed in memory cells like a computer.",
							"Thus, Dynamics are stronger in synthesis operations (not mere simple connections, but confluence of associations), while Statics are stronger in analysis (not just any separation, but clear and precise delineations). Thus, the discrete/continuous pairing has more to do with the StaticDynamic dichotomy, than with otherwise customary Rationality/Irrationality. But then, what exactly is the latter? Irrationality indicates situationality (predominance of context over aim), while Rationality indicates regularity (predominance of aim over context).",
							"Social Level",
							"Differences between Dynamic and Static types at this level corresponds to the contrast between initiators and finalizers.",
							"Dynamics are stronger at the beginning of any activity: they easily move and quickly enter the realm of nominal activity. Rapid transitions from a previous state into a new process of change itselfthis is their customary life. Statics better sustain and continue what has already begunthat which is already in motion. They must be preliminarily excited.",
							"However, in the Dynamic is a process of continuous readjustment of focus and ‘drift' of purposes. Because of this, the priorities of Dynamics are volatile and poor in hierarchical coordination. One wish may be quickly replaced by another and it is difficult for them to concentrate on any one specific long-term goal without external support. The strength of Dynamics is not in retaining goals, but in achieving them; they are better tacticians than strategists.",
							"The objectives of Statics are more stable and reliable. They know what they want and are able to maintain long-term focus upon it. They arrange priorities in their life and work, with well-differentiated primary and secondary objectives that are rarely reversed. Statics are more successful strategists than tacticians; they know what to do much better than how to do it.",
							"A predominance of Dynamics in any social group renders it unstable, prone to endless change, and sensitive to external interference. Conversely, if predominated by Statics, then rapid transformations prove to be impossible due to excess psychological inertia, rendering the group stabler but more conservative.",
							"Psychological Level",
							"The StaticDynamic dichotomy controls the degree of equilibrium in the nervous system. Generally, the nervous system of Statics can be regarded as balanced and Dynamics as unbalanced.",
							"This is tied to variability in the internal state commonly referred to as ‘mood'. The mood of Dynamics, even if Rational, can substantially change or fluctuate for seemingly insignificant reasons (from an outside observer POV). The Dynamic wants total freedom but is more dependent on ambient environmental conditions and needs a solid foundation.",
							"Statics possess a relatively autonomous psycho-emotional state; their mood is difficult to spoil, and equally difficult to raise. For Statics, providing reliable support to those psychologically depending on them is a routine situation.",
							"Dynamics often develop a psycho-physiological phenomenon known as ‘synaesthesia'a complex relationship between the sensory modalities that results in confluence between them. Synchronized perception of color, sound, smell, and taste as a single complex gives Dynamics a special vividness in their perception of reality. Sometimes fusion of sensation is developed to such an extent that internal images appear indistinguishable from reality. For Statics, given the discreteness of their mental apparatus, regular synesthesia is usually a rare exception or the result of special training.",
							"Physical Level",
							"At this level, StaticDynamic manifests as contrasting impulses to biological homeostasis/heterostasis. Homeostasis I understand as constancy and heterostasis as variability of the organism and its surrounding environment.",
							"Dynamics are heterostatically inclined to change their material conditions of life such as wardrobe, home interior, or furniture arrangement, for sake of variety or out of boredom. For Statics this tendency is uncharacteristic. Only with difficulty do they proceed with changes to their home environment to which they have become accustomed. They will do so only when it's easier to yield to circumstantial pressures, than to resist.",
							"As types with variable metabolism, Dynamics can rapidly grow stout, though just as quickly lose weight if they fall into a state of emotional distress. Statics have the opposite problem, of a stabler weight and build: if already seriously fat (or thin), they remain so for longer times. Their bodily metabolism is more invariant.",
							"The same laws apply in relation to other physiological parameters such as temperature, blood pressure, perspiration, etc. For example, the body temperature of Dynamics may fluctuate during the day even with no overt symptoms of illness. With sufficient training, Dynamic types can consciously change these parameters in the desired direction."

The Fe/Ti oscillation distrusts the subjective component (Fi) to be sufficient to answer the question of whether someone is moral or not, and prefers for that to be transcendent of the subject.

Others' conditions inform one's actions; one feels compelled obligated, required by a metaphysical law, to act in a certain way. And this does not neccessarily mean an obligation to be \"nice\". Rather, it is an obligation to act according to reasons that are consistent with all possible states of affairs. Thus, to it, Te/Fi seems like egotism and solipsism, the way of animals."

However, an Fi/Te demographic cannot go about this by leveraging the outside-in imposition of morality that Fe manifests and prefers, and thus it takes a more logistical trajectory towards its solutions. The public sphere becomes a very bureaucratic domain; a mechanistic enterprise whose function is to provide that which subject(s) desire and reward participation in some material form. A culture built entirely around Fi/Te would be a domain of egos who manage and uplift one another’s needs through an established economic system; allowing for each to flourish in their own identity and individuality.",
							"Now, naturally all humans ponder every type of philosophical question, but the Fi user will tend to steer away from vacuous channels of deduction that are void of any animating principle. The question of ontological truths are handled by Fi, but with the “a priori” embedded within it since Fi will carry the necessary ethical axioms to address existential questions at the root level. Ti, on the other hand, draws its ethical answers from the dynamic human environment and leaves the philosophical domain as one that’s handled with sterility of reason. This is the case even if Ti’s answers cycle back around to, and support, the ethical answers that are arrived at in the end. Indeed this difference causes Ti/Fe to be more explicative with morality even if both share the same general opinions of how best to live. That which Fi/Te believes implicitly and simply lives out, is linguistically encoded by Ti/Fe due to how it parses the question out differently.",
							"Disclaimer: I should note that Fi/Te users are capable of gracefully handling social situations too, but via a different metabolic route that is explained in this post. Their adjustment to social settings can be handled as a logistical solution via Te, even when it involves having courtesy/etc. The moral effort will still be in Fi, not Te, causing a somewhat uncanny execution."

However, it is not inherent in extraverteed thinking what results it should look for, or what the parameters of measurement should be in a given case. What is missing is the desired goal, provided by introverted feeling (Fi). Thus, the \"best measurable results\" are whatever kind of results the individual determines to be most desirable; the objective parameters follow from this original subjective decision. Thus, this is contextual judgement: it is based on the particular needs of the person when they made them (i.e. the position from which they fired their arrow).",

The extraverted realm is a wealth of raw data that is appropriated by the interpreting subject, which orders the data in accordance with its own singular perspective. The more extraverted one becomes, the more various the species of categorization used, until the categories become indistinguishable from the data itself. But the more introverted one becomes, the more these species merge into closer orbits around the feeling subject, where the original goals are revealed. Ideally, all of one's actions and judgements are meant to align with, or be natural emanations from, that original source.

							"In its most general form, I understand this dichotomy as ProcessResult; or by its other informal name, RightLeft. More precisely, I refer to the designated Latin words ‘evolutio': “developing outward” and ‘involutio': “coalescing inward.”",
							"Intellectual Level",
							"Describing EvolutionInvolution at this level will initially contrast deductive vs. inductive thinking. Unfortunately, the bulk of literature on this cognitive dichotomy treats it in at least two different senses. In the first sense, deduction is understood simply as a strict formal sequence or expository progression of thought (aka Socionics rationality), while induction is understood as conclusions stemming from practical experience (aka Socionics irrationality).",
							"I will frame this dichotomy in the second sense, namely as simplification vs. complication of thought structure. Meaning that in deductive thinking, given a set of simple and obvious statements (axioms, postulates), the resultant consequences can be necessarily derived (theorem). Reasoning flows in the direction of simple to complex. Evolutionary types therefore mentally complicate the situation.",
							"In inductive thinking reasoning proceeds the other way around. Observing and comprehending complex phenomena, inductive thinking reduces them to generalized diagrams and models stripped of details. Involutionary types break down and simplify the situation in order to understand it. Reasoning flows in reverse order from complex to simple.",
							"The EvolutionInvolution dichotomy confers different scales of examination in a problem. Evolutionary types see small to large. Details are distinct. Scale is specific and precise like geographical map. Involutionary types on the other hand, see large to small. Details are vague. Scale is general and broad. The scale will alternate in Negativists, since they think more alternatively, but the same priority will remain.",
							"It is worth noting that deductive thinking has always had priority in society over inductive thinking. Constructing a deductively consistent theory to explain a phenomenon, has always been seen as a researcher's coup de grace.",
							"Social Level",
							"On the social level, differences between these approaches can be contrasted as naturality/artificiality. By ‘naturality' I refer to primal behavior inherent to nature, and by ‘artificiality' I refer to behavior accepted by society. For example, in nature, survival of the fittest is law, whereas in society, protection and care of the weak is cultivated.",
							"From this stems distinctions in one's attitudes towards people in close or distant circles. In the life of Evolutionary types, reputation plays a much greater role. Opinions of others in external society tend to be more important to them than opinions of friends or relatives. Involutionary types depend less on social appraisal. They are more accommodating towards people of their inner circle, whose opinions they hold in higher esteem than those of public approval or disapproval.",
							"There is a habit in Involutionary types to abruptly curtail conversations. They do not simply cut off communication, but specifically wind it up, quickly finish, or summarize what has been said. They may also suddenly deflect onto tangents, then flip back to the topic at hand. Evolutionary types may interpret this mannerism as a sign of tactlessness, disinterest, or resentment.",
							"Psychological Level",
							"EvolutionInvolution, along with other dichotomies, influences a key parameter of stress in the psyche: Control of asymmetry in the excitatory/inhibitory processes of the nervous system.",
							"Evolutionary types recover more slowly from stress than Involutionary types. Their inhibitory processes are less amenable to conscious control than their excitatory processes, hence their tendency to dwell on personal issues. After being pulled in by any process, they are often unable to get out of it. Which can lead to gambling, drug use, alcoholism, or other vices, even Internet-addiction.",
							"Consequently, susceptibility to conditioning is higher in Evolutionary types than in Involutionary types. Conditioned responses require movement along a single path, without possibility of turning around or deviating from the imposed route. One of the inhibitory mechanisms of conditioning is phobia (obsessive fear). Imagine not being able to rid yourself of thinking you will definitely fall on a slippery road. This is an example of a phobia. And then you actually do end up falling, even if wearing mountain-climbing boots. According to my observations, Involutionary types do not seriously suffer such phobias.",
							"Thus, Involutionary types more rapidly and less painfully get rid of illusions, imposed opinions, suggested thoughts, fanatic states, etc. It is because of EvolutionInvolution differences that quadras are split rings of social progress are formed.",
							"Physical Level",
							"The EvolutionInvolution dichotomy manifests on the lower level of communication through an orientation towards either process or result.",
							"Evolutionary types are more inclined to procedure, which involves careful study of details. They are subject to the logic of the development process, which assumes motion from beginning to end and top to bottom.",
							"Involutionary types rush to obtain a result, frequently neglecting details of the process, which reduces overall quality. Such behavioral patterns lead to a tolerant attitude towards returns and corrections. They don't mind accepting suboptimal, but convenient solutions. They are characterized by backward motion, from end to beginning and from bottom to top.",
							"Let me illustrate this by an example of reading books. Glancing immediately at the end or bottom part of the page is characteristic for Involutionary types. Reading in reverse order does not deprive them pleasure of novelty, on the contrary, it stimulates their activity in assimilating information. Involution shouldn't be confused merely with impatient skimming ahead, after which one continues smooth reading.",
							"Sharpness of movement is observed in Involutionary types, along with sporadic shifting from one activity to another. These sudden shifts overtly contrast to the smoothness of Evolutionary types. In traditional Socionics, sharp movements are attributed to Rationality. In my opinion, however, this quality is more determined by Involution. For counterexample, consider the Evolutionary Rational types LSI and EII, whose motions are characteristically soft and smooth. Yet the nature of movement in Involutionary Irrationals SLE and IEE is so sharp that training them smooth movement is practically impossible.",
							"To clarify the fundamental distinction between Involution and Evolution, the following analogy will help. In biology, catabolism and anabolism are the two sides of organic metabolism. Catabolismthe breakdown of complex compounds to release energy and the elimination of decay products from the organismcorresponds to the role of Involutionary types in group dynamics. Anabolismthe assimilation from the external environment of substances necessary for life and their transformation into more complex compoundscorresponds to the communicative role played by Evolutionary behavior."

For the Ne/Si user, information starts with Ne. Then after Ne’s cycles decay, what is left over is epitomized in Si as a static anchor point made up of the idea that was generated. This effectively makes Si a library of stored abstractions, rather than literal representation of the moments which transpired. The literality of the Si function comes in the fact that each dataset stored is static in its properties, unchanging, and can be references with the same concreteness as any data would have if it had actually happened just as observed. If the concept Ne stored was not too far removed from the actuality of that moment, there will be some fidelity in the translation. This happens more when Si is given higher priority, because Ne diverges less from objects as it absorbs it’s data (Pe). Nonetheless, there will still always be some extrapolation from the sensory world which happens in all Si users, causing Si’s archive to be a collection of conceptual registrations over time — which we can term Impressionistic. No matter what the hierarchy, the Ne/Si user will have this impressionistic quality to their experience.",
							"Additionally, as a Pi function Si will aim to form a comprehensive view of reality that encompasses every domain. But since not all domains are woven together, this complete understanding is achieved by a pluralistic approach, not by having a convergent unity. This is directly due to the N attitude (which is the associative operation) being tied to the Pe function and not Pi, causing thematic strings to be woven into things at shorter ranges via Ne. The smaller range of Ne’s associations leads necessarily to a modular mode of registering reality for the Ne/Si user. Now, a unified view of reality may still be inserted from a certain J paradigm, but this P axis will not generate that intuition about the universe by itself.",
							"Disclaimer: This lack of literality doesn’t mean that an Ne/Si user can’t ever perceive reality as it is. But it will be energetically taxing for Ne to stay on the same beat/object (i.e. lock on) for multiple cycles. This becomes easier the more Si is involved in the duality. And just as a wrench can be used to hammer in a nail, Ne can be used to take in (Pe) the world as it exists but it will have to discard its own divergences to re-focus continually. This will lead to a level of mental fatigue and even so the detail may not be completely grasped (or stored) but perhaps sufficient for the task at hand."

Therefore it is more difficult to fully integrate Negativists into a group. Positivists on the other hand, are inclined to close range communication.

It is observed that Positivists are drawn towards their opposite, which contributes to overall group solidarity, particularly through the ease of intragroup role distribution. Negativists on the other hand, have an inherent paradoxical attraction to those similar to themselves. The nearer such parallel charged elements converge, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to implement mutual action. Repulsive forces rapidly emerge and fracture group integration.",
							"The overall incidence of monolithic or polarized group behavior is a reliable index for gauging PositivistNegativist tendencies. Negativism generates tension in intragroup relations, leading on one hand to an increase in psychological distance between members, but on the other hand activating its internal momentum to say “Move!”. Positivism by contrast contracts psychological distance and encourages internal group cohesion, but can also bring complacency, carelessness, and ‘vapidity' of existence.",

							"Each type of person behaves in life according to how they answer the following existential question: is human nature inherently good or evil? For Positivists, human nature is inherently good, so they are more likely to be trusting. This does not mean that they consciously consider themselves to be good, just that they conduct themselves as if others were. Negativists even under favorable conditions are inclined to expect the worst. Their degree of trust in others is therefore is much lower.",

The theocrat articulates the ineffable and translates it into articulated space, but the anarchist retrives the ineffable from articulated space. The theocrat begins in the mountains and descends to the city; the anarchist begins in the city and retreats into the mountains. While the theocrat seeks to lead everyone up the pyramid, to a shared point of unity, the anarchist seeks to lead everyone back down, to each person's own point of individuality. The theocrat takes unique clay from within themselves and sculpts it into something people can share; the anarchist takes the homoegenous clay of their environment and sclpts something only the initiated can appreciate. \"And the kin-less of the world\", said Saint Paul, \"and the cast aside, God chose with the things not being: that the things being he might make naught\". While the theocrat takes the rare and ineffable, and makes it understandable and ubiquitous, the anarchist takes the understandable and ubiquitous and makes it rare and ineffable. They increase the distance between individuals (while the theocrat seeks to decrease it). Kierkegaard's psuedonym, Johannes de Silentio, explains in Fear and Trembling that, \"The knight of faith knows...that it is glorious to be understood by every noble mind...Thus Abraham could surely have wished now and then that the task were to love Isaac as becomes a father, in a way intelligible to all, memorable throughout all ages...[but] he knows that it is a solitary path he treads and that he accomplishes nothing for the universal but only himself is tried and examined\"."

							"The moral factors are suddenly become important and gain in momentum, and then fourth quadra, Delta comes into place. In this quadra, human relations and human values are most important. I don't know when this is going to happen. Right now the global socion is at the stage of third quadra. The truly “moral” quadra is really the fourth quadra. LSE, the Administrator, is the type that will turn over management in entire world by making it more decentralized. In Europe this has already happened, but in Ukraine and Russia we're far from it because everyone wants to keep power in center, nobody will willingly hand it over to the regions. We still have a long road to travel until reaching fourth quadra in administrative sense. For LSE, work brings profits and profits accumulate. Even though he is a workaholic, clear, organized rhythm, in the end he will ask himself: for what have I been preserving this wealth? At the end of life, travel, see the world, and then what? There are few children born in the fourth quadra, nobody to pass the wealth to. Thus charity work begins. In this quadra there are a lot of problems due to sense of uselessness - I have worked and worked, but for what?",
							"IEE, the Advisor, is the implementer of fourth quadra. He evokes interest, interest turns into excitement. But IEE is not ESE, the Enthusiast. In this quadra this excitement will not last long, even socionics as a novelty does not last with them. Boredom ensues. IEE brings elements of absurdism and disorganization. Then comes EII, the Humanist, who brings general human values that have always been and will be: kindness, and not the kind where you help black people in Africa, but directly help you neighbor or your friend and keep quiet about it. People of this type do not like telling about the good that they do, they feel ashamed of it. True kindness is the kind where you do not speak of it - this is proper upbringing, ideology, duty because in civilized society sense of duty is always valued.",
							"Next comes SLI, the Master - this is convenience, technological zenith. In this quadra, it has all been worked out already, the skill is perfected - there's nothing further for technology. There is a lot of leisure time, the city is abandoned to spend time in the country. Society starts to disintegrate, return to nature comes into effect. Apathy. Everyone is asleep. A dull moment in this world. SLI sees: although I'm well, live out in nature, breathe fresh air, but there is no emotion, no enthusiasm, maximum efficiency has been reached. All results have been achieved - this is the end socion. What remains is to go back where we came from.",
							"Here I have described in figurative forms how the clock of socion ticks. It work on all levels: at the individual level, and group level, and within the socion as a whole. What exists above the socion? I do not know.",
							"“After the critical work of the third quadra the way is cleared to enter the arena for the last in the cycle fourth quadra or \"delta\". Its perception of the world is harsh and realistic. It best relates to the element of earth. This quadra consists of the following sociotypes: LSE, EII, SLI, IEE. Earth is the most conservative but at the same time the most fertile element. In general such is the atmosphere of the quadra which unites realists who value stability and proven traditions above all else. Among them differs Huxley who is able to get involved in the unusual but even he in general is oriented towards the other side of the common in search of sensations.",
							"Sociotypes of this quadra have the following values. Firstly +Fi () good, warm relationships. Psychological factor plays the vital role. Without ethical values of positive character (such as recognition of religion, individuality and everyone's uniqueness, non-interference into the inner world of a man, concrete humanism and etc.) the stability that they strongly support is hardly possible. The second value -Si() - the existence of good working conditions, lack of discomfort, unwillingness to change the existing order of things, exclusion of harmful influence of the environment - in short to minimize negative sensations. In this quadra one can't work in a rush, comfort of the working place and coherence of the collective is highly valued. Most important place given to ecology and clean products.",
							"Thirdly the fourth quadra is oriented towards the aspect of +Te() which implies the logic of the use and management of the resources. This is the most cost-conscious quadra which is able to efficiently consume and prefers high quality and sturdy products. For sociotypes of this quadra risk, rush, economic chaos and fraud are unusual. Society of qualitative consumption can only be stable.",
							"And the fourth value of the quadra is -Ne() aspect meaning the alternative, unusual and sensational. Despite their grounded nature sociotypes of this quadra respect unusual and talented people who offer alternatives. In any case obstacles for the spread of new information no matter how avant-garde is not valued. Therefore in the community located on the fourth quadra stage periodically break out some sensations, outbreaks of interest towards original people and what they preach, alternative ideas for development are pushed forward.",
							"Social mission of \"delta\" quadra therefore is to ensure the stable development and judicious use of accumulated resources while preparing the ground for the weak seeds of new. Main quality of such societies (this includes most of the Western countries) is stable use of material and spiritual products. Only in conditions of stability can exist the development and spread of new and still very fragile and unprotected initiatives, beginnings, movements. In history of Russia such stable periods include for example the reign of Catherine II during which the \"golden age\" of Russian nobility happened. Or the industrial boom in Russia at the beginning of the XX century before the First World War. Psychological age of the quadra is old age. It has to bear the fading, torpor and relief. Wisdom and experience accompanies the last period of life that lies on the basis of respect for tradition and a significant proportion of conservatism which is so characteristic for sociotypes included in this quadra. Their time of year is Winter, which they meet not with empty hands.",
							"Stability for all its positive qualities also means a gradual stop of life. Absolutely stable systems can not endure for long as by law of entropy they decompose and degrade. But life is prolonged as during this period the search for alternative ways ends - finally forms and spreads the new trends that offer new paths of social development that reject traditional ones. One of these trends starts to rapidly grow namely that in which decrepit society needs most for the new revival. A new triumphal march begins - after winter comes the new spring. In the depths of the fourth quadra inevitably unfolds and proceeds to action the first one. The entire development cycle is repeated. That is how the complex mechanism of humanity works which we call the law of social progress. While quadras are socio-psychological units that determine the chronology of this process.”"

Self-destruction leads to the loss of special units of expanded reproduction and society is being reshaped to form enclave that is symbiotic existence with nature.

									"Delta - the quadral complex of “clipped [undercut] wings”, as any quadral complex, comes from a set of four aspects that predominate in this quadra: evolutionary logic of actions (+Te), evolutionary ethics of relations (+Fi), involutionary intuition of potential (-Ne), and involutionary sensing of sensations (-Si), that form three dominant quadral traits:",
									[
										"1. “Aristocratic” trait (rational aspects are evolutionary, with a plus sign; irrational aspects are involutionary, with a minus sign: +Te, +Fi, -Ne, -Si) In accordance with this trait, every person has the right 1) to establish relations of subordination 2) to create a hierarchy, support and protect it 3) to support already established within the hierarchy traditions and rituals and keep track of their observance 4) to subordinate those below him and to comply with those above him 5) to put claims to the dominant positions within the system and to fight for one's right to occupy them 6) to fight for and to accumulate positional advantages in rights, privileges, and opportunities 7) to interact with others from positions of advantage 8) to suppress with the authority of personal opinion and action 9) to control and critique the statements of lower ranking members of the hierarchy, limiting their right to expression on any forbidden subjects 10) to authoritatively impose one's own point of view, decisions, power, and will.",
										"2. “Objectivist” trait (predominance of evolutionary logic of actions and ethics of relations: +Fi +Te) In accordance with this trait, every person has the right 1) to trust their personal experience - professional, pragmatic, business experience derived from personal observations - and insist on one's right to further act in accordance to it 2) to trust facts and to become persuaded by facts - to provide them as the main proof of one's correctness 3) to evaluate the situation by already transpired facts and to act in accordance with circumstances existing up to date, trusting one's own experience and one's notion of expedience of a particular course of action 4) to evaluate a person according to the level of his qualifications, based on facts of his professional training, attainments, and competence 5) to remove (or ask for removal) from work those who are inept and negligent, to push them out from work and projects 6) to fight for one's own participation in work or a project, for one's place on a working team, and to be able to defend it.",
										"3. “Judicious” trait (predominance of involutionary intuition of potential and sensing of sensations: -Ne -Si) In accordance with this trait, every person has the right 1) to develop their own creative abilities and talents, to be proud of them, and to demonstrate them at any convenient opportunity 2) to freely develop one's own creative potential, to choose an occupation by one's preferences 3) to at length discuss any interesting to them topic from perspective of multiple meanings, demanding respect towards one's opinion irrespective of whether or not one is knowledgeable of the topic 4) to respect the opinion of authoritative experts, to make references to authoritative sources (for as long as they are considered to be so) 5) to indefinitely talk about and discuss an interesting to them problem instead of resolving it (or in place of resolving it)",
									],
									"The confluence of predominating aspects assigns the following properties to the Delta Quadra: - boundless perfection of one's skills, pursuit of the highest (beyond the bounds, even other-wordly), professionalism (+Te↑); - unlimited expansion of allowable opportunities, pursuit of transcendent possibilities (-Ne↑); - constant renewal and updates to sphere of interests; renovation and expansion of one's habitat (“resettlement programs”); aspirations for out-of-bounds spaces (-Si↑); - perfection in the area of ethical interactions; the pursuit of the highest spirituality to the otherworldly dream of “peace and cloudless happiness for all mankind” (+Fi↑).",
									"Out of the combination of the properties of all aspects that predominate in the Delta Quadra, there arises a very high level of competition of ambitious creative plans, prospective original ideas, and valuable innovative projects.",
									"To call oneself an author, an organizer, a sponsor, an implementer, and promoter of such projects is in itself already venerable. The main thing is to not remain apart from such important and promising developments, but to be able to join them and in time exert one's influence, leaving on them the imprint of one's talent, to keep up in making contributions to such significant and socially meaningful works.",
									"All this excitement of the creative fever makes Delta Quadra be very meticulous and demanding towards the creative and spiritual demands of others. In the fourth quadra, that person is not worthy of attention and respect, who is not absorbed by a creative thirst, who does not strive to realize his own potential, who is in no hurry to develop his own talents, skills, and abilities. It's not possible to write of the 4th Quadra in a modest tone - this cascade of creative plans, this firework of extravagant ideas.",
									"If in Alpha Quadra it is shameful to not have a retort, in Beta Quadra - to be weak and helpless, in Gamma Quadra - to be lazy and inactive, then in Delta Quadra it is a shame to not strive for self-improvement, a shame to cease working on yourself. If Delta Quadra tells others: “You still have something to work on,” - they sincerely believe that they are doing good work by raising the bar of demands (and thereby putting themselves in the position of a strict critic, a teacher, a creative mentor), making others perfect and improve in their skill and abilities in order to unravel their potential. On the other hand, when they are subjected to criticisms and find themselves in an undesired position of a “student”, Delta Quadra gets offended by such self-appointed teachers and tries to escape from their “care” and “mentorship”, retorting with: “I'm satisfied with everything about my work. I'm content with what I'm doing and not in need of outside advice.” (If this is said in presence of an ethical type of Delta Quadra, one may get immediately reprimanded: “Why are you talking like this with this person? He wanted to help you, to offer his advice, and you …”)",
									"The mere fact of such a critical remark already serves as a cause for irritation: that some all too proactive person has showed up and taken the opportunity, the situational advantage, to address others from the position of a critic: that this person was able to hurt/sting someone's pride and to impose his own view. And who has asked him to do so? Who has put him in the position of an arbitrator? By what right does he speak here?",
									"Delta Quadra is afraid of:",

										"underestimation of their creative and possibilistic potential;",
										"any restrictions imposed on their possibilities and creative potential;",

										"afraid of the incompetent, haphazard, chaotic influences that may be exerted by ambitious ignoramuses, illiterates, non-specialists, and self-appointment arbiters on their work;",
										"afraid of their stupid questions and primitive conceptions that involuntarily force them to lower and understate the level of their work, to adapt and fit it into another's narrow and miserable worldview; afraid of any comments that remind them that out there there's a huge number of ignoramuses who consider themselves in the right to bring all the creative potential of a person down to their own primitive level, and later, using words of other “authoritative critics”, guilt and shame this person for the “primitive” and “crude” level of their work."

										"of stupidity, jealousy, and ignorance of random self-appointed critics who can, incidentally, with a single careless and tactless word or action, push them down from the height of their achievements and honors (simply because some enjoy being destructive)."
									],
									"Delta Quadra fears the destruction of all that they see as valuable, good, positive, wholesome and is afraid of people who destroy from feelings of envy and jealousy, out of their own inadequacy, or out of boredom, having nothing to do, “just because”, “to have some fun in life”.",
									"The fear of these destructive influences, the fear of shattering of one's hopes and creative plans, awaits the creative person, who everywhere runs into the envy and the envious; the fear of the inability to realize one's own creative potential, being surrounded by jealous and vengeful people, who self-assert and entertain themselves by the destroying other people's creative initiatives and plans; the fear of being thrown down from the heights of honors and attained creative goals - such fears constitute the most wide-spread phenomenon in Delta Quadra.",
									"The destruction of hopes connected with the realization of ambitious creative goals, the fear of obstacles that arise along this way, the fear of limitations placed on the creative and possibilistic potential, in this essay we will conventionally call the COMPLEX OF CLIPPED WINGS.",
								],
								"The high demands of Delta Quadra.": [
									"Becoming a hero, or a professional and specialist of the highest class in Delta Quadra is very respectable. But what gathers even more respect is to go beyond the permissible possibilities and to become a visionary, a prophet, a psychic healer, a miracle worker, or a saint. The plank of standards and demands in Delta Quadra is constantly being raised higher and higher - what yesterday was in the realm of impossible, today is almost commonplace.",
									"On the background of such ambitious demands, even the highest instances of heroism and professionalism begin to dim, while the achievements of other quadra seem almost laughable. In Alpha Quadra, Deltas are frankly bored: there it all starts and ends with conversation, while one can only dream of real success. Of Beta Quadra there's nothing to say: there everyone is trying to seize power, to make a career, instead of “rising above” and aiming for those frontiers that are higher than any worldly power. Gamma Quadra are generally boring people. What can one talk with them about? The only interests they have is work - home, work - home. And this is life?",
									"Another matter is the fourth quadra. Here lies the real expansive field for creativity! The real freedom for imagination! Here, any person is either enlightened or genius! Here, even a simple bum is not a nobody, but a wandering philosopher, a treasure chest of wisdom, an abyss of talent.",
									"Here in Delta Quadra real life abounds! Here is the real society! Here is the light!",
									"It presents a difficulty for Delta types to live among representatives of other quadra - their demands and expectations are too high and hard to live up to. The hardest time they have in the orthogonal and opposite to them Beta Quadra, where on mere self-opinion and conceit one cannot get far. Neither will the Beta Quadra permit a person to depart to virtual reality - they will bring him down to the solid ground, push him out as the “weak link”, lead him to a “monastery” as a “sacrifice”.",
									"Neither it is always easy for the Delta Quadra to exist among their own: on the background of high, ambitious ideas, there arises high competition of projects and plans that are only enough to announce to assert oneself. One person voiced something, another made an announcement - and lo and behold, they started to respect each other for the next half an hour, further waiting for their words to become embodied into actions, into something concrete - waiting for that miracle that has to happen. (And if this miracle doesn't occur, it is always possible to change the facts - to say that somewhere it has already happened - and someone has even witnessed it and was able to use its results: and thanked for the good advice and the miraculous method or remedy.)",
									"Like any other “objectivists” - pragmatists, Delta Quadra - are masters of bluffing, mystifying, and elevating their own value. The leaders of this quadra are the “declaring”, “child-like” intuitive ethical types - who are protected by their snobbery, convinced of their rightness and of their higher destination, and certain that intentions can justify the means if only the intentions were good.",
									"If the “mystificator” has not seen to his entourage - if it didn't occur to him to gather sufficient protection, to surround himself by a mysterious and secret aura, if he hasn't thought out the execution and technology of his wonders - this means that it's time to push him out, to displace from the pedestal of a kind of “miracle worker”, to ground him, to bring him down to earth where he'll be shown his real place. Let him work and dig the earth like all ordinary people if he is incapable of anything else.",
									"On the other hand, how does one ground him if he has imagined who knows what? - if he has acquired influential friends, if he gets broadcasted over TV to millions of people - how can he be stopped?",
									"And a sharp word is for what? - Here, it will undercut his wings.",
									"There are enough wits and sharp tongues in the fourth quadra. Here everyone is JUDICIOUS and has no trouble being glib-tongued, never at a loss for a word or a retort. And since these are “judicious” “aristocrats” “objectivists”, Delta Quadra knows how to stand up for themselves by word and by deed: they know how to keep at a height, how to keep on dominating positions (at least situationally), how to defend these positions (even if for a brief moment) by the facts of their real (even if momentary and short-lived) situational victory over their contact.",
									"If not by word, then by deed that the Delta Quadra (mostly, intuitive types) will win over their contacts or potential competition - by a deed, that to the detriment of their contact, in his name but without his consent, will put him in a humiliating position, from which he won't soon recover, that will “frame” him on all counts, and, at the same time, add to the “weight”, privileges, advantages, and rights of the one who has so cleverly set him up. (To do “a good deed” such that the recipient ends up in a hopelessly dependent position, and in addition to that, to receive benefit and use for oneself - of course, for this one needs to be refinedly tricky.)",
									"To get caught by hand at an embarrassing deed, Delta Quadra - especially the intuitive ethical types - dislikes very much. To feel a sting to their self-esteem and to become humiliated in the presence of other people can be very discomforting to them (especially when they were aiming for new heights). It's painful to them to feel such “cuts” on their “wings”, that pull them downward, helplessly and powerlessly sagging, forcing them to leave ingloriously the higher spheres and to give way to the pedestal for others.",
									"Delta Quadra is very sensitive to the collapses of their hopes and ideas, their intellectual, spiritual, and creative plans.",
									"For those who fly too high, the downfall is painful. The fear of this downfall is a widespread manifestation of complex of “clipped wings”. Attempts of developing protection against this fear by “falling in love” with one's fall (“To lie in the sweat of vice and admiration for one's own downfall …”), to morally degrade yet still be above judgment and scornful valuations, subjectively insisting on one's own moral superiority - is one of the most common defenses from the quadral complex in Delta Quadra - even open sexual relations are not considered something reprehensible - for what could be wrong with love? (-Ne↑; +Fi↑).",
									"Delta Quadra does not tolerate: - When their right to spiritual, moral, professional, and creative self-improvement and self-realization is challenged; - When their moral, spiritual, intellectual, and professional superiority is questioned and challenged.",
									"For Delta Quadra, especially intuitive types, it could be painful to witness the intellectual, spiritual, moral and professional superiority of others - due to which he wishes to humiliate them, the more so the more this turns into real successes and advantages for them. Envy towards the success of others - is one of the most widespread manifestations of the Delta Quadra complex of “clipped wings”: the fewer personal successes, the more ambitions and the more jealousy is aimed at the successes of another (the feeling of personal loses needs to be compensated for somehow).",
									"Delta Quadra does not tolerate: - When their right to an all-sided and fullest implementation of their creative ideas, their possibilistic, intellectual and spiritual potential is being challenged; - When someone is challenging their right to enjoy (even slightly) their successes, plans, and fantasies. - When they are not allowed to be proud of them, to rejoice at ridding of the envy towards other people's success, to rejoice at the victory over their own pride.",
									"Delta types can engage in creative self-realization, in attempts to find themselves, in self-development and perfection until very old age (if they are not obstructed). The motto of Delta Quadra is: maximum successes, opportunities, and prospects - to maximize the implementation of all that is possible and wanted.",
								],
								"Spontaneous control and aspirations to dominate as a development of protective measures on the quadral complex of “clipped wings”.": [
									"Considering it to be debasing to themselves to become included in the process of fierce competition that suppresses business and creative activities of the participants, Delta Quadra first tries to exclude from their sphere of business and creative interaction all factors that could generate such competitive conditions. Therefore, in the process of spontaneous interaction with others, they establish relations of subordination, that would allow them to correct their actions and establish over him ethical (moral, spiritual, psychological) as well as professional and business control.",
									"In Delta Quadra, each considers himself or herself entitled to control and correct the behavior and actions of others. All of this is done in the framework of professional, business, or ethical initiatives, that Delta Quadra does not consider necessary to concede to anyone else.",
									"On the fact of actual domination and spontaneously folded relations of subordination , in the process of interaction in Delta Quadra, each person becomes either the dominant (self-appointed and self-willed) - the controller, the mentor - a person free and independent of someone else's will, enabled and entitled to correct and control the actions and expression of others - or he becomes a dependent, the suppressed, the “controlled”, made to obey the demands of “controller-mentor”, to spontaneously “report” and “confess” in front of him (as well as others if the dominant commands it) at his first demand.",
									"(**) Unlike the “aristocrats” “subjectivists” of Beta Quadra, Delta Quadra as “aristocrats - objectivists” do not need system hierarchical appointments to the dominant role. They themselves claim the rights to dominate, i.e. out of their own initiative and by the circumstances: whoever has kept up, takes the power; whoever was skillful enough managed to redistribute it within the system (his work group, team, family); those who can retain their positions within its framework. But even in this case Delta Quadra as an “objectivist” quadra does not consider itself obliged to obey any system relations, based on the basic principle of objectivism, “person above the system” (“individual rights above the rights of the system”), related to the predominance of objectivist logic of actions (Te) in both third and fourth quadra, and the displacement of aspect of system logic of relations (Ti) to a subordinate position.",
									"“Showing care” for the “controlled”, Delta Quadra may at any time demand from him a report on anything. And won't rest until they receive a sincere and truthful answers to all the questions that interest them. They won't back down until they manage to impose their own conditions, opinions, and solutions onto the “controlled” concerning all aspects of his life, until they obtain a full report from him about all the events happening or planned in his life, until they learn of all that the “controlled” thinks and feels, of what is happening in his soul and of what he has in his mind. (This is called a demonstration of true personal sensitivity in Delta Quadra - true care for one's neighbor).",
									"As the result, a rather flexible and dynamic hierarchy forms, in which the dominants change quite often. The winner is always the one who at all times keeps the priority positions for himself or herself:",

										"The one who monitors the situation from the point of view of his or her personal, even if momentary and short-term, leadership or dominance;",
										"the one who biulds and controls any situation from the standpoint of his or her personal (even if self-assigned) privileges, rights, and benefits; who models all the factors and all the conditions affecting the situation in accordance to his own personal plans, intentions, priorities, and ambitions;",
										"the one who has the last word, opinion, or action, and who can impose it on the “controlled” as a kind of immutable absolute with which the other person needs to comply (often due to some previously achieved agreements, which are now “inconvenient” to reject);",
										"the one who always knows best what and how needs to be done, when and to whom one needs to speak and what to say, and who constantly teaches this to others, while now allowing to get taught himself;",
										"the one who always controls others but doesn't recognize any control over himself;",
										"the one who finds flaws and faults with others, while ignoring or not taking seriously the criticism in one's own address;",

									],
									"All of the above listed conditions make the “dominant” person in Delta Quadra develop a fairly complex and double-moded position within the system of relations, but in hierarchical Delta Quadra society such a position is fully possible, natural, and acceptable.

								"Moral superiority as a development of protective measures against the complex of “clipped wings”.": [
									"The ability to incline others to make concessions while not conceding themselves - is one of the greatest victories of Delta Quadra. Slogans: “Think about others!”, “Yield your rights to another!”, “Give up your privileges for the benefit of others!” - turn out to be that very same measure that curbs the rights of others, allowing the Delta “controller-mentor” to act in full swing, to the maximum of his strengths and abilities, to the full extent of his potential, while he himself remains free from any possibilistic limitations. By controlling and subordinating others, he obeys no one himself - nothing binds and chains his own creative initiatives and plans, nothing hinders the growth of his ambitions and the creative flight of his imagination.",
									"In Delta Quadra the skies are free and open for all (in theory!) - each person has the right to freedom of creative self-expression. Each has the right to endlessly cultivate his or her talents, to later realize them in grandiose projects that bring benefits to society, moving it far ahead.",
									"With such an abundance of “flights” of individual creativity, in lieu of of this (even if imaginary, conditional) encouragement towards active creation (“Create! Take off! But do not obstruct others!”), in “heaven” - in the realm of creative and business beginnings of Delta Quadra - space becomes just as overcrowded and tight as on the ground, in the mortal bustling world of Gamma Quadra and all previous quadrants.",
									"Therefore, in the “airspace” of bold creative explorations and ambitious darings of Delta Quadra, one should be particularly polite and careful so as to not cast down one's contact in a case of a collision, so as to not cause him irreparable damage by this - such are the rules!

Those who violate these rules are not taken into the team, but instead pushed out of projects and business, taught and re-educated at every step, ruthlessly “broken”, and, after losing all hopes for their rehabilitation, passed around a mile away.",
									"Themselves Delta Quadra, in an effort to seize initiative and come out to a leading position, also go around these rules. Sometimes they aggressively react to the slightest resistance to their opinion, their will, wishes, action plan, and initiatives. (This is understandable and acceptable: their natural (“aristocratic”) desire to dominate, to aggressively impose their opinions and will (“heterogeneity on trait of aggression”) is what allows them to self-organize into hierarchies and establish vertical chains and links within the system.)",
									"Another option - is the assertion of moral superiority and domination through the accumulation of ethical benefits (+Fi ↑) - manifests itself in the pursuit of the superficial, illusory peace, due to which Delta Quadra itself, and especially “child-like” ethical types, often fall into the position of a victim, encountering deaf resistance and lack of understanding of their positive ethical motivations.",
									"Imposing on their contacts the “game of giveaway” and relying on reciprocity in yielding and making concessions (at least out of politeness), Delta Quadra is upset and disappointed when they are instead met with a boorish, user attitude to their generous and sincere offers of love, friendship, and mutual assistance … Their dreams of mutually beneficial, pleasant, and relaxing interactions turn into dust - the world is, as it turns out, not ready for such pure and sublime relations. A feeling arises of condensing “crowdedness” and disarray, simultaneously - a sense of harsh and vicious struggle and confrontations, where all are pushing each other, pushing out, pushing away, casting down from dizzying heights, ruthlessly undercutting each other wings; refusing to understand each other even when explanations are given. A desire comes up to “punish”, to reject all of this frustrating and disappointing reality, but this doesn't fit with the postulated ethical principles, among which modesty and forgiveness - are principal.",
									"Although, later on, after the battle, one may “shake his fists”, recall all the lost privileges and to try to restore them. One can conduct “educational work” with one's contact (especially if this is a close person or a permanent partner). Talk with him seriously, condemning his behavior and reminding where and in what he was wrong, to “teach him for the future”. The one who is first to find a fault to pick - the first one to seize the initiative, the first to express his offense and disappointment, the first to capture the role of the “mentor” - will hold a “debriefing” of all the “take offs and flights”, and will leave the last word to himself - he will become the “supervisor” and push himself into the role of a “dominant” in his current relationship. He will impose onto his contact the role of the “guilty”, thereby pushing him to subordinate positions, and monitor his behavior at every opportunity, reminding him of his past (real or fictional) faults and guilt - “he didn't say the right thing”, “didn't look the right way”, “upset or offended a person by a defiant tone “… (the possibilities are endless here).",
									"Further on, this still situational “dominant”, will continue to struggle for the right to control the actions of his “ward”. He will monitor his behavior, his current personal ties and relationships, reprimand, edify, and mentor, and, raising the demands, seek further concessions from him. Arbitrarily changing his system of evaluations and attitudes towards his “ward's” actions, the “dominant” will manipulate him, pushing him into an even more humiliating subordinate position. He put the “controlled” into a more dependent position, which subsequently will become more constant and fixed by established tradition, habit or ritual. The “subordinate” will be required, at a certain intervals, to report of his actions, hear out new criticisms, get new “instructions” and strictly comply with them, and then report on them again.",
									"Any attempts to change anything in these relations that have folded up to date may be deeply disappointing and hurtful to the “mentor”: it turns out he wasted his time in vain - his hopes to “re-educate” the person did not realize - his work did not bring any results. For each new disappointment and frustration, for the destruction of hopes and illusions and inflicted in connection with this offenses, the “controlled” will have to answer again: regardless of the outcome, the educational effect on him will be exerted with an even greater, many times multiplied force.",
									"And every expenditure of effort needs to be compensated. Thus, the “controller” (expecting a recoupment of all “costs” incurred by him in the present and in the future) also becomes a victim of his educational project - a victim that very “hoax” into which he initially pulled the “controlled”. It will be a good resolution of this situation if the “controlled” person, faced with real fruits of this labor, realizing himself a helpless and nonviable “zombie” - a puppet in foreign hands, a victim of other's ambitions and foreign evil will - does not repay his “controller” with all that is due, and thank him in full measure for all the “good” - for all the forced and irreversible concessions, for the inescapable humiliating position, for the series of omissions that have left no hope and no chances for the future, for his crippled by bondage and slavery past and present life, which essentially isn't a life at all.",
									"The habitual conviction in his own correctness does not allow the “mentor” to admit his own mistakes. When faced with the actual evidence of his guilt, he, even if he plays the game of “being hurt”, won't deem himself to be “guilty”. The false, polysemous pathos of Delta intuitive types and characteristic for them snobbery - is a common characteristic of Delta Quadra's complex of “clipped wings”. And it often gets expressed as an effort to renounce and turn away from the realities of their existence, and soar in their own opinion of themselves, to an out-of-reach for others subjective idealism, in a bid to be above any objective criteria and evaluations, remaining inaccessible to being compared with others in their own closed off and self-contained world of their own inflated self-esteem.",

									"The desire to create a situation that is conducive to conflict and violence, and to cultivate within it the role of a victim, becoming the recipient of sympathies of others - can also be seen as a manifestation of the complex of “clipped wings”: the person wasn't allowed to feel free and uninhibited in a public place, his innocent caprices and pranks were cut short, he was upset, offended, disappointed, his desired entertainment was ruined - what is all this, if not a limitation of his personal freedom, his personal rights and possibilities (-Ne↑)?",
									"And Delta Quadra loves “fooling around” - they are people, too, though closer to angels, preferring not to see or to have any imperfections.",
									"Delta intuitive types especially like to get mischievous (it is no accident that, same as Alpha intuitives, they are called “child-like”). Through “harmless pranks” they push the boundaries of what is permissible to them and expand the realm of options and possibilities. By ignoring what's not permitted, it is possible to subtly expand the boundaries of what is permitted, of the normative behavior that “as a joke” - “just for fun” - getting merged and blurred in its boundaries with non-normative acts, can shock someone “a bit”, offend them a little, or considerably disconcert and baffle them.",
									"Especially when there is an experiment at stake (one that pushes the boundaries of what is permissable), any evil can be regarded as good. In any case, limits imposed on their private initiatives are a sensitive and painful topic for Delta Quadra: who likes getting caught by their hand, especially over something so minor as an innocent prank, a funny joke, a cruel hoax, a jeering parody or mockery - what could be more harmless?",
									"In defense of the complex of “clipped wings” also works the popular in Delta Quadra slogan “We are born to turn fairy tales into reality”, which constitutes a reference to the expansion of the realm of possibilities and the study of limits (and transcendent spheres) of possibilistic potential of human beings, which happens chiefly at the expense of others. (As a corollary of pragmatism, associated with predominance of aspects of logic of actions (+Te↑) and intuition of alternative potential possibilities (-Ni↑), and quadral traits of “aristocracy”, “objectivism”, and “judiciousness”.)",
									"Delta Quadra literary and cinematographic works provide telling illustrations of the interest in this subject. For example - a person working in the sphere of other-worldly possibilities, enthusiastically involved in fantastically bold experiments - is the theme of the famous works of Mikhail A. Bulgakov (LSE, Stirlitz) “Heart of a Dog” and “The Fatal Eggs”.",
									"Drawing a person into a competition, enticing him get involved “on a dare”, captivating him by an extravagant idea, and then using him as a guinea pig in a dangerous experiment, here does not constitute a problem - if only there's a wish! Volunteering “Icaruses” who wish to fly up all the way to the sun in Delta Quadra are found soon enough (and if not, can search in the other quadra). Moreover, the “commander's order” and the “parental mandate” is given to them a tone that does not allow any objections. And how could it be otherwise? - If one takes risks, then risk big, if one expands the boundaries of permissible possibilities, then do so in full swing, on big scale, with a greater advantage over the others.",
									"It is for this reason that Delta Quadra is so persistent with its plans that they do not see as possible to back down or deviate from them. Thus, they persistently impose them on the designated “realizers”, pulling volunteering enthusiasts into a whirlpool of events, out which it is not possible to get out without incurring losses and damages (otherwise, what kind of an experiment would this be?). For this, the “volunteers” get thrown “into the orbit” of the creative and research explorations of Delta Quadra and retained there against their will (the experiment cannot end ahead of time!). After all, someone needs to take the risk. Someone or something needs to be sacrificed - especially when one wants to distinguish oneself, to become famous and well-acclaimed, to become a sought-after figure, to show oneself and demonstrate one's creative potential in something new and unknown but useful and interesting to the public. And in this the influence of the quadral complex of “clipped wings” can also be glimpsed, which prohibits Delta Quadra from abandoning their dreams, from turning away from their plans and goals, and pushes them ahead to realize themselves at any cost.",
									"The checks for out-of-bounds abilities of a person - his beyond the limits endurance and capacity for work, his limitless compliance, humility and kindness, an attempt to transform and turn a wretched primitive being into a highly spiritual being - are very prestigious and popular in Delta Quadra. (Especially if one is allowed to achieve outstanding results: who does not want to feel himself a miracle worker, a magician, a Pygmalion?)",
									"One problem arises here: this search for new wonders sometimes corrupts the potential “miracle worker”, especially if his ambition has no limit, his conscience is lacking, and his moral foundations are not too strong.",
									"In this way, for example, in an effort to show herself as an outstanding folk healer, one sweet lady of type IEE, Huxley, a physician's assistant with extensive work experience, experimented with the healing properties of raw potatoes on her children and grandchildren, insisting on them being a universal alternative to all existing medicines. Using raw potatoes as a supposed effective remedy for healing wounds, she forbade her children to treat their cuts and wounds with a disinfectant (a solution of alcohol or iodine) and instead made them hold a tampon filled with grated, raw potatoes to their cuts. Many times she has tried this household “curative” remedy, and the result was always the same: an abscess would start, the child suffered, she urged him to be patient and wait a little longer: “The pain will soon pass and you will feel good!”. Only when the inflammation was rampant and the children developed a fever, would she send them to a clinic and allow them to get treated there. (Feverish and sick, they had to sit in reception, wait in line for their turn, then explain themselves before the doctors.) Over the years, she ran such experiments alternately on her children and grandchildren, who lived under the same roof with her for a long time, who were under her constant influence, under her watchful medical supervision, fully trusting and obeying her in all, despite the fact that her tips each time brought them to trouble. Ignoring the real, the actual results of this “therapy”, she cheerfully reported about the alleged successes to her friends, telling them about the miraculous properties of the raw potato, and urged them to practice this method, referring to the fact that “for her grandson these potato lotions helped”. Expanding her circle friends, she announced and asserted herself as a successful folk medicine healer, and continued to use the people in her household as a reserve for new experiments.",
									"In an effort to become famous and acclaimed, Delta Quadra types can go very far. The “side costs” of their “research work” meanwhile aren't much taken into account - they quietly drain the bounds of patience of their “subjects”, but then conclude: “Yes, in principle, a person is capable of much!” And from here it's possible to bring the game to a new level and, to pull the person into a new “hoax”, to make him agree to taking even greater risks and making greater expenditures and sacrifices - after all, it is interesting to know the limits of his possibilities!",
									"But later, how pleasant it is to talk about one's successes with one's friends! How nice and how rewarding it is to boast of them!",
									"And what horizons open up! One can make new, useful connections, acquire beneficial acquaintances, expand the one's circle of friends and supporters. One can find new “guinea pigs” to involve them in new experiments and new competitions, egging them on to participate. Excite and stimulate them by demonstrations of own success and aspirations. One can also advantageously use the results of one's experiments for future developments and plans. For example, it may be opportune to bluff a little and tell of them to one's new, influential friends, advertising and promoting oneself to them as a physician, spiritual mentor, counselor, coach, healer, manager or leader.",
									"And from there on - the revenues are already pouring in, and the bright future (at least in the form of personal, material well-being) draws closer by two or three steps. And one can cheerfully report of their achievements, trumpet them at every step, boundlessly raising one's rates and elevating one's worth. And no one will dare to “clip the wings” of such a successful and influential person - no one dares to contradict him, to challenge his opinion, expose him as a layman, to push him out of the next project, to oust him from his “starry sky”. From all this he is now exempted and protected by his influence, authority, and growing popularity - a powerful defensive measures on the quadral complex of “clipped wings”.",

									"In light of the established situation of intense competition of business and possibilistic initiatives (+Te↑, -Ne↑), each person here wants to demonstrate their creative individuality in the most brilliant and memorable ways. Each hurries to express himself in the most unconventional and original manner, to get into the center of public attention, devising opportunities to demonstrate their individual abilities and talents.",
									"A minute of fame in Delta Quadra - is very valuable! But its price is often not taken into account. The main thing - is that the success or achievement doesn't go unnoticed and unappreciated, that the talent does not get buried into the ground. Thus everything that is more or less significant (or worthwhile) here is paraded and shown. “To get into the display window”, to become a celebrity, a model of success - what could be more prestigious?",
									"To win over recognition and popularity in society, to consolidate one's influence in artistic and political scene, to hold it for as long as possible, to learn how to by word and by deed influence the hearts, souls, and minds of humanity, directing it to a happy bright future - constitute the most prestigious goals and objectives of Delta Quadra.",
									"High self-esteem, weight and importance of personal views and convictions - all of these qualities are necessary to sail on the crest wave of fame, to be at sufficiently high level in the shared stream of ambitious aspirations in the field of creative activity of Delta Quadra. Due to this, each member of the Delta Quadra tries to present him/herself on the general background in the most advantageous way, to impart a winning impression and create the best recommendation for oneself, to appear as the person who can be relied upon in difficult times, someone who can be trusted, who can be “placed bets on”, counting for an easy and quick success.",
									"The excitement around success often leads to the fact that many undertakings in Delta Quadra begin to assume the form of “big marathons” or “prestigious horse races” - a “prestigious auction” on a “vanity fair” in which each of the participants, regardless of personal successes and achievements, presents himself as a sort of a “valuable lot,” evaluates other people around him from the standpoint of personal superiority, viewing them in the reflection of his or her own successes and excellence.",
									"The competition of ambitions and aspirations - is a usual phenomenon at this “vanity fair”. Pomposity, snobbery - here are the top selling features and common qualities. Prestige - is the universal measure of all values.",

To set a goal - even if shaky and ephemeral - and follow it as one's guiding star, striving towards new horizons of success.",

									"Here lies one problem - the idols get changed too often on this “vanity fair”. Into the “open doors” of aristocratic society of Delta Quadra - a society of fickle and interchanging tastes and interests - new trends and new “celebrities” are constantly breaking in and pushing out their predecessors - those who have already “played their number” on the stage and are now made to leave this joyful world and return to their former gray, joyless workdays.",
									"To return from this mirror-crystal world of illusory contrived reality to the harsh mortal world of the actual existence - is same as falling from the sky to the ground - same pain after the fall, same shock of hurt and frustration, same coming sober and waking up from an enchanted dream. The reluctance to descend down to harsh and crude reality, the desire “to remain above this”, to soar up high, to rise “above it all”, to “take off” and make up for what was lost at any cost, encourages members of Delta Quadra to return again and again to the previous field of opportunity, back to the society of “open doors”, to their former fans and supporters, counting on their renewed interest and support.",
									"In a society of equal opportunities (in a socialist society), where all levels of aspirations were averaged out, each attempted to realize himself in an acceptable and conforming way, trying not to offend others. Due to which, the behavior of the “vanity fair” carried an introverted character (dominance of TIM SLI, Gabin) - each played a role of a kind of “treasure chest full of surprises” - presented oneself as a person mysterious and unpredictable - remained “a mystery” in oneself and for oneself.",
									"In a society of humble intellectuals of 1960s, a society of physicists - lyricists, individuals who attempted to win recognition within this circle, qualities of ambitiousness and unpredictability were suppressed and considered to be in bad taste. Insead, rich in meaning deep submersion into one's own spiritual world was the valued currency in this “vanity fair” of intellectual elites - due to which all of its representatives resembled a collection of ancient Egyptian artifacts, who could trace their origins all the way to the Great Sphinx. A mysterious look, looking into infinity, a polysemous enigmatic smile, detachment and insularity in their own world far away from the worldly life, made them resemble this ancient figure. During gatherings, each of them either “mysteriously” kept silent, or talked about something of his own, getting more and more pulled into the transcendent world of his dreams and distant from realization creative plans and interests - a world from which no one will displace them or prune their wings in flight.",
									"Memorable episodes of “vanity fair” of this type could be seen in movies of the Soviet cinema. For example, in a film (about the 60s youth) “July Rain”, directed by Marlen Khutsiyev, a group of young people get together and each asserts himself in his own individual way trying to make a favorable impression of himself. Each talks of his interests and hobbies. One - solves crossword puzzles, another - tests new acquaintances on psychological tests. One - tries to show off his erudition, some - discuss problems of production and talk on abstract themes. At the same time no one is really listening to anyone else, each is looking somewhere into the distance, into the open space with a detached and bored look. The feeling of complete estrangement - is the only thing that unites them all. The impression is that they are already quite tired of each other.",
									"The desire to escape into another world, into a different reality (-Si↑), into the realm of alternative potentialities (-Ni↑) and unclaimed creative initiatives - is a characteristic manifestation of Delta quadral complex of “clipped wings”: the wise “bird - Phoenix” has not yet been reborn from the ashes, has not yet resurrected for a new life, or it's still deep in slumber, saving and preserving its creative potential - the most important thing!",
									"A striking example of such “vanity fair” is given by director Kira Muratova (IEE, Huxley) in her film “Passions” (a 1994 film about creative youth in the age of stagnation): all of the characters are consumed by themselves and meet, talk, and mingle only to talk about themselves, their passions and hobbies. Each tries to make their monologue interesting, each demonstrates in-depth erudition in their field of interest. Here, again, no one is listening, no one sees or notices anyone else. All make an impression of being lunatics, who are looking somewhere distantly, into the void, with unseeing eyes and talking incessantly about oneself and only about what is interesting to them.",
									"The lifestyle aimed at the preservation of creative potential - creation of a kind of “greenhouse for talent” that are left to mature in a conductive, comfortable, household environment in anticipation of better times - is a characteristic mark of Delta quadral complex of “clipped wings”. Often it takes the form of organization of family pastimes that include a demonstration of the fruits of talents and creativity at a small local family “vanity fair”. (An example of how other quadra relate to this is presented in the famous movie “A Day on a Train”. The protagonist of this movie, Valentin Grafta, type ILI Balzac, after interacting for several hours with his former college friends (Delta types), evaluating their achievements on personal, professional, and social fronts, watching through all of their “demonstrative performances” of family amateur creations, feeling sated with their stories about their success, involvements, inventions, and achievements, begins to feel himself next to them as an incompetent and hopeless loser, explodes with irritation, and breaks off all the ties with them.",

And domestic discussions, debates, evening literature readings, home clubs “by interests”?",
									"All of this would be great if it weren't for the complexes (quadral and individual), if it wasn't for the tension, that inevitably arises between the audience and the performers, even if the performers are very professional and good. What, for example, is the value of the tradition of preparing the “next young generation”, in which the children become hostage to their parents' ambitions and victims of their snobbery? A child against his will, despite his requests, tears, entreaties, is forcibly taught music specifically to this purpose. He or she gets traited for the purpose of situations of domestic concerts, hearing: “Imagine you'll grow up and go to a social gathering. There others will remind you that you have studied in a music school. You will be asked to play something on the piano. And you won't be able to - and will be in a shameful and awkward position. So, to avoid this, go and study music!” The parents themselves are actually setting higher and more ambitious targets, but for the child they present an everyday, minor yet ambitious goal: at the median level it's sufficient to come forward, to play, to perform, to attract attention to oneself, and this is already enough to stand out among others.",
									"The child initially actively opposes, objects, and argues with the parents, promises not to tell anyone that he has attended a music school. Then submits and for a few years continues to practice, gains experience, performs at private family concerts and local school performances. Then learns how to play the guitar - just in case, if the guests don't have a piano. Then, having prepared himself a repertoire, pays visits only with the guitar - just in case, if he's asked to play and sing a song at a gathering. Then it becomes habitual for him to play and sing upon request at every evening meetup, giving free concerts on demand, on the principle “what would you like to hear, sir?”, as if he's trying to earn his presence at the party. As then for sure he ends up in a humiliating position, that stems - most importantly - from that very same program which was imposed on him in early childhood, when he was taught demonstrate his abilities and talents at family meetings and visitations.",

Simultaneously, they get offended by the quick loss of interest in a recent object of their attention, if his hobbies are uncovered to be trivial and his talents - modest. The frequent change of “idols” in Delta Quadra, their frequent switching from one object to another (sometimes much less interesting) is irritating to other quadra. What irritates are the drops in quality standards in the assessments of talents and interests of each new “favorite of the day”, unjustified trust for his self-promotion, indiscriminate treatment of his abilities, overestimation of his creative potential. (A person slapped some paint onto two or three canvases, and they are already intoxicated with enthusiasm: “Look - he is a true artist!”). Irritating are the contradictions in the behavior of these “treasure hunters”, their “blindness” and indifference to the real successes of their loved ones who are meanwhile in need of their help and support.",

One of their loved ones may be working hard, performing all the wonders of self-sacrifice, trying to please them and their “infinitely demanding taste” (especially when they are constantly raising the bar of requirements). While some random stranger appears on their horizon, declares himself a great author or artist, and completely takes over their attention, making them speak of him in most glowing and enthusiastic terms and recommend him to their circle of friends, which they immediately rush to do, while being generous with praises and compliments. It comes to the fact that every new acquaintance gets questioned on the topic of his hobbies and interests. As soon as he appears on the doorstep, the first question asked (right in his presence): “How is this person interesting?” - heaven forbid to overlook a new talent!",

If the public is disappointed - no problem! - next time there will someone or something more interesting. (And for the collector of the “artifacts” this creates a reason to again remind the audience about himself, to show himself as a discoverer of new talent - and, if there is a wish, even out of mediocrity one can create an interesting person, if only there was something there to work with. With the wish even a glass shard can be presented as a diamond, if only there were willing buyers!)",

They form the ideological concepts that allow a person to leave this harsh reality for an alternative transcendental world (dominant traits of “aristocracy” and “judiciousness”) and simultaneously keep the person in the real world by fear of getting pushed out due to objective reasons (dominant feature of “objectivism”). These factors create tendencies that allow Delta Quadra (intuitive types) to influence the conditions of formation of relationships in the world, in order to ultimately improve them and bring them to a high level of purity and beauty, by means of which it is intended to bring together the real world with the world of the desired (and imaginary), thereby making the real world more welcoming and comfortable for people of the finest spiritual nature.",
									"Failure to reach this goal by simple and accessible means in the foreseeable short periods of time leads ethical intuitive (“child-like”) types of Delta Quadra fall into despair, forcing them to resort to searches for new alternative (and often illusory) conditions for existence, in which (in their opinion) the real world won't be much different from the imagined.",

In an effort to reconcile this contradiction, Delta Quadra types (primarily ethical) form a two-moded attitude to the objective reality - they set up and organize for themselves and for others a “life in a pink light”. (For themselves - voluntarily, for others - by suggestion or imposition.)",
									"This vision is realized in a very simple and unsophisticated way: all that is negative gets placed outside the brackets, negative phenomena (or even discussions and stories about them) become excluded from the scope of human communication in hopes and calculation that positive traditions, observed as a ritual and instilled into the framework of law, will, at some point, completely replace negative phenomena (and related vices) of which people will simply forget. Negative phenomena will disappear, leave with the past (like an atavism), and the reality will become no different from the desired virtual one. And then one would no longer need to wear the rose-colored glasses - the world will become more kind and supportive, and the negative will simply find no place in it. Until then it is necessary simply to reject and turn it down - to not talk about it, to not mention it, to not be interested in it, and organize social interactions and relationships in a way that excludes the negative from the very start, as a phenomenon that in itself is very dangerous.",

									"In Canada, where the integral type is TIM EII, Dostoevsky, delicate attitudes are shown everywhere (people are exceptionally friendly, tactful, and sensitive). But this doesn't go down without its excesses. Particularly sensitive attitude here is shown towards those who are most touchy and easily offended. Offense on the grounds of jealousy is taken into account in the first place. For this reason, it is customary here to organize friendly or corporate parties with proportionate distribution of treats (“a party in the style of EII”). It is believed that this method ensures sensitive and humane attitude that excludes envy and resentment over the fact that someone ate more while someone else got a smaller serving. From this comes the rule that you cannot bring your own food, because this breaks down the quantitative balance of treats, and the hostess would be offended thinking that her culinary talents were underestimated. When a party is organized as a potluck or from contributions of the attendees, everything is thought through to the finest detail. The number of guests is calculated as well as the number of servings, and the purchases are assigned according to this calculation so that each person spends about the same amount of money. (So that no one is offended or financially strained). Corporate parties don't even need to be mentioned - everything is strictly calculated and distributed to those attending. Refreshments can be most modest. If needed, the party can do with one slice of pizza and one can of Coke per each person attending, if only no one is hurt or dissatisfied.",
									"And it isn't that important that under such circumstances a corporate party is more like a holiday celebration in an orphanage. (No one notices this. They are already used to it.) The main thing - is that everything was done in fairness and harmony in human relations was achieved. The behavior of the guests at the party is strictly controlled. And how could it be otherwise? - One omission, and the grievances and accusations start: “Everyone was supposed to take two slices of pizza, but someone took four, and now another guest didn't get his food.”",
									"To avoid this, - to avoid even the possibility of such thing happening, a new method was developed for corporate parties (again, in the style of EII), under which each employee is issued a number of multi-colored tickets before the event. With these tickets, he goes to the “food dispensary” (no other name for this) and on each ticket gets the proper portion of food. It prohibited to exchange or pass the tickets to others, so that no one sees someone else getting an extra portion and feels cheated himself.",
									"Such is the system. Terribly primitive and very flawed in itself, despite the best efforts of the organizers to make it extremely ethical. The backfiring (corrupting) result is achieved due to the fact that such organization works to morally support the jealous and envious people, setting up for them most favorable and sparing conditions. (An extra piece in someone else's mouth doesn't prick their eyes - most importantly! The effect is, however, that the vice of envy and jealousy under such conditions is not overcome - instead benign conditions are created for it.)",
									"This system is in principle unethical not only because it involves coercion against the person (what kind of holiday is it when every piece is counted!), but also because the ethical issues here are “resolved” (figuratively speaking) by means of logical manipulation. The aspect of ethics of relations of EII Dostoevsky (+Fi/-Ne) that extends good treatment for all, here gets replaced by the aspect of logic of relations, of fair distribution of LII Robespierre (-Ti /+Ne), giving it a dominant position, forcing it to appease the situation and work here instead. With such substitution of ethical aspect for logical one, every person feels themselves under pressure (in forcibly imposed on them conditions) and under the supervision - and becomes aware that he or she isn't trusted, which is a humiliating realization.",
									"As a result, in the depths of their souls, everyone is offended by mistrust and by large don't feel themselves partaking in a holiday celebration. Under such circumstances, it's still a long way to go towards harmony in human relations. What kind of harmony is it when everyone is under surveillance! What this means is that this method doesn't solve ethical problems. Or it does solve them, but only in the “alleged”, imaginary, subjective, artificial ideas and notions of the organizers, who believe that they are doing the right thing: “people need to be re-educated”. And then the question arises: how much more time will it take to re-educate them? When can one start trusting them?",
									"After all, at one point, someone will have to loosen control and take off their rose-colored glasses - and what will we see then?",
									"If one's own personal strength is not enough to overcome envy, greed, and mistrust towards others, then what about the prerogatives of the evolutionary ethics of relations (+Fi) - of which moral self-improvement or moral achievement can be talked about? If a person is spared from the responsibility of having to answer for his actions before himself, then his own inner moral framework is never formed: he invests no efforts into building his own moral codex, into his own moral improvement, and instead relies on external ethical dictates to lean on them as support. And if conditions are created that eliminate the need to struggle against one's own flaws and temptations, then there are no positive developments over them - strong conscience, love of one's neighbor, sense of responsibility, sense of duty and loyalty towards friends, none of these are “activated” or in demand here, and, over time, with such conditions, these ethical notions may completely atrophy.",
									"It turns out, we're not going in the right direction by increasing emphasis on involutionary logic of relations (-Ti) instead of evolutionary ethics of relations (+Fi). (Which can sleep soundly: its bright future is still very far away.) Judging by the tenderness and refinement that get attributed to its more pure and ideal forms, it is only in demand among angel-like people. Until then, it can peacefully rest, cushioned on all sides with cotton wool, in anticipation of better times that will never come if the hearts and souls of the people are not made to work (on the aspect of ethics of relations) - if a person is not encouraged to overcome his own temptations and resolve them by his own strength and means.",
									"And another question arises: if it is so difficult to organize faultless (excluding psychological discomfort) ethical attitudes within such modest scopes such as a friendly or a corporate party, then what can there be said about control of global evolutionary processes and transformations, which is the prerogative of the evolutionary (“strategic”, large-scale) ethics of relations? And where will these global transformations and ethical processes emerge from (many of which are spontaneous and uncontrollable), if even a minimal strain on, a minimal toughening of one's soulful and spiritual forces is avoided here in order not to complicate life for oneself and others?",
									"In such circumstances, we can't even talk about fighting and eradicating negative phenomena. It is simpler to forget about them, to close one's eyes and not remind oneself or others about them - which is what the defenders of “healthy lifestyle in pink light” prefer to do, instead choosing to impose a great number of prohibitions and restrictions on the thoughts, feelings, words, and deeds of other people.",
									"Of personal shortcomings it is not allowed to speak here. (That is, they don't prohibit this to themselves, but to other people - those who, in their opinion, have gone beyond the limit of criticism.) And this is also a sign of quadral complex of “clipped wings”: why disappoint a person by describing his negative personality traits? Let him think that he lives among angels. Let him think only good thoughts about other people. Because if he finds out about their shortcomings, he may lose faith in them. Or can use their shortcomings for his own selfish purposes, turning the way that is so undesirable to see him. Thus, it's best to allow him to be deceived and deluded, to look at the world through rose-colored glasses - and even to actively to impose such view of life, rather than to allow him to become disappointed with everything and plunge down like a stone into the abyss of vices and passions, realizing the most grim shadow side of his soul.",
									"Offended by the whole world, disappointed in friends and partners, a Delta intuitive type can “fold his own wings” and spiral down into the abyss of despair. However, he won't blame himself for this, but society that has disappointed him and the world that did not live up to his expectations.",

This comes from that very same fear of disappointment in the realities of the everyday world, that gets combined with the fear of getting pushed out of cozy and comfortable existence in an idealistic microcosm into the ruthlessly brutal world of harsh surrounding reality.",
									"One only has to embellish one's reality with impressive fictional events, pulling up the actual towards the desired, and adding to this personal conviction in one's correctness, motivating these actions by good intentions, that the intolerably gray and humdrum reality begins to sparkle with bright colors and new bright future prospects. Then imaginary reality will organically merge with the real one, and fruits of the play of imagination will become fruits of artistic creation - and there's nothing wrong with this. The person who by virtue of inexperience or naivete doesn't distinguish the real from the imagined will be at “fault” himself for this error - he will fall victim of his own or another's deception. In any case, the “creator” of the “image” won't consider himself to be “guilty”. His job - is to push the boundaries of the reality in order to amend it with another. And if to be successful in this one has to distort facts, either darken or lighten one's prognoses, toss up some long-term plans, there is also nothing wrong with this (in his opinion), especially if it will help a person achieve a lot in life, to believe in himself and in his own strengths, to pick his path. The “creator” is not worried by the fact that a lie is still a lie - with the help of his interpretation it turns into a convenient tool for modeling a new and better reality for himself and for others, it becomes extensive means of psychological manipulation, which become the more justified by good intentions the more opportunities they open in the framework of this new “imaginary” reality, needed by him to achieve personal plans and goals.",
									"An example:",
									"A young woman of type IEE, Huxley, a nurse by profession, has gotten divorced with her once beloved husband of type SLE, Zhukov - a simple, kind man without bad habits, but psychologically incompatible with her and “not suiting the court” - coming from an “humble family” of open market traders, a man “gray” and “ordinary”, without high and noble aspirations, and lofty goals (which he “demonstrated” when he dropped out of college and went to work at the market so that he could provide for his family). All of these circumstances (including adverse intertype relations) served as a reason for her to soon divorce him, to sign him out of the apartment, evict him, and deprive him of parental rights, erasing him from her life and memory. The child was adopted by her second husband of type LSI Maxim. This second marriage, though it was prestigious, was also short (luckily for all). The child (IEI, Esenin) got a little older and started asking about his father, but was unable to obtain reliable information: much of family history remained mysterious and incomprehensible to him. To assuage him, his mother created a legend about a tester pilot who died in training flights. After finishing school, the boy decided to follow in the footsteps of his hero father, but didn't dare apply to flight school and instead enrolled in military engineering department, graduated with honors, had a distinguished military career, started his own family and had children. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel when one of his distant relatives opened his eyes to the family secret - told him that his father is alive and well, and lives nearby, in the same town, and works at the nearest market in a shoe repair shop. The son was stunned by these news. He could never forgive his mother.",

									"There are many variations to this: it is possible to make a person “stoop low” imposing on him an unpleasant errand by request or order. One can force another person to perform dirty or humiliating work, or make him commit an embarrassing or socially disgraceful act. And all this is done so that afterwards one can exalt oneself through his humiliation - so that later, when the fact of his degradation is made obvious, one can tell him: “Ugh, how low you have fallen!” - exactly when he's almost digging the ground with his nose, actualizing the whims and caprices at request or order of the one who then humiliates him, contemptuously disparaging him for it. **",
									"(**)The name itself “Game of sand cakes” Eric Berne - American psychiatrist and psychoanalyst - has taken from the novel of Charles Dickens “Great Expectations”, citing as an example an episode in which a willful, capricious girl asks a boy to make for her cakes out of sand, and then proceeds to humiliate him, saying: “Eww at how your hands are dirty! And yourself - you are fully dirty!”. Eric Berne provides a psychological analysis of this episode in his book “Games that people play. The psychology of human relationships” (1966).",
									"In the story above, “sand cakes” was the game that was played with the first husband by the ambitious nurse of type IEE Huxley - the one who divorced him because he dropped out of college and went to work in the market to financially provide for his family and meet (in the first place) her own material needs. As soon as her husband solved this problem for her, she immediately accused him of giving too little attention to the family. When he began giving more attention to the family, studying and working at the same time, she faulted him in getting poor grades. When he filed the documents with the institute to leave it, she chided him that he isn't developing spiritually and intellectually. When he got frustrated by all this and lost hopes of dissuading her, she condemned him for his hot uncontrollable temper and shamed him by his “marketplace family”, that he eventually ended up rejoining.",

The desire to cool someone else's creative enthusiasm, to “drop him through the floor” with a critical remark - is a widely applied counter-measure of suppressing counter creative initiatives in Delta Quadra, where competition of projects and ideas is extremely high. In connection with this, the situation becomes rather strange: on the one hand, all are admiring each other, on the other hand - criticizing and biting into each other. The winner is the one who receives criticism and compliments indifferently, keeps fans at a distance, and does not give in to the influence of self-willed “mentors”.",

									],
									"The position of “cut your own wings to not get clipped by others” is one of the variations of “the game of fox and the grapes” that is widespread in “aristocratic” Delta Quadra, where in order to attain superiority sometimes it is enough to play the role of a person who is satisfied in full with his own successes, but extremely demanding of others. (Up to not allowing them to get a word in - interrupting, pulling them back, cutting them down at every step, constantly distorting the meaning of their words, finding faults with their meaning and with the manner of their statements.)",
									"Being demanding towards others in Delta Quadra sometimes takes a convenient form of “benevolent mentoring” motivated by the limited possibilities of the “mentor”, who, for real or imagined reasons, does not want to demand the desired from himself, but asks this from others “from best intentions”, striving to develop their creative potential with the most effective and efficient methods and direct it at ambitious goals (for everyone's benefit and enjoyment). It is assumed that with the rapid growth of their success his “mentees” must compensate and justify his own very modest achievements. At the same time, it is imperative for this “mentor” under all conditions to stay in his own “moderate” position - to not demand more from himself and to remain himself.",
									"The main reason for choosing such moderate position lies in the awareness of the ordinariness of one's own abilities and achievements, in realization that with such weak and humble endowments one should not join competitions and “step forward” without a good reason, but also to not allow others “to lower him lower than the floor” and step under their criticisms (right and wrong, spontaneous or pre-planned): “Let everything go as it goes, be what will be - we don't wish for that which belongs to others and won't take their prizes away from them, but also won't allow ourselves to get subjected to their judgement.”",
									"As a result, the position of “convinced mediocrity” gets constructed, under which it is possible to bring any base and any motivation: one can refer to one's modest needs, wishes, and opportunities, that are already “too late” to develop (or simply “not really wanted”).",
									"The sacrificial embodiment of this position is also popular: “It would be desirable to be happy for someone who is truly “gifted” is not for oneself. From myself what could be expected? Everything is already established. Let it go as it goes, in its usual order.”",
									"The position of “ostentatious modesty”, “moderation of one's desires”, awareness of possibilistic self-limits and restraints - are common in Delta Quadra as the position of an alternative eco-niche, which is convenient to occupy in the face of brutal competition that goes all around. The position of “ostentatious modesty” is also convenient to develop as a protective measure on the complex of “clipped wings”: one who doesn't soar high spreading his wings but quietly hides in his shelter, is less likely to get shot down, and that in itself is already good: he quietly opts out of the game, leaving taking risks to others. And the fact that under these circumstances one's “wings” soon become unnecessary and burdensome - is also not an issue: a person, like his biological ancestors, should be able to master other spheres and elements of nature.",
									"The position of “convinced mediocrity” - a person undemanding towards himself, but highly demanding of others - in Delta Quadra is most often taken on by SLI, Gabin. Gabin does not tolerate criticism. It wounds his ego and his pride, hurts his self-esteem, forces him to abandon his ambitious plans out of fear of being forced out of them, of being ridiculed, destroyed, thrown down from his pedestal, humiliated in his own eyes (and in the eyes of all those who believed in him), out of fear of personal and professional setbacks. Criticism - especially silly, absurd, and unprofessional - places a blow on SLI's quadral complex of “clipped wings” and makes him doubt his own abilities, strength, and capabilities. Getting over these doubts for him (as a overly sensitive and suspicious “asking” introvert “aristocrat”, suggested on the aspect of intuition of potential +Ne) is always very difficult.",
									"“The game of the fox and the grapes” as a demonstrative refusal to storm the difficult to reach peaks of mastery aids the SLI to “stay in flight” at a comfortable for him level of moderate flow of creative forces and feasible for him (average) rate of implementation of his plans.",
									"SLI Gabin is very afraid of criticisms of potential possibilities (his creative aspirations, achievements, and plans), in presence of which he cannot be successful in his dual dyad: IEE Huxley despises failures, deadbeats, and hopeless “losers”, but his “dear loves” and “favorites of the day” he often encourages with positive forecasts on the aspect of intuition of potential, causing them to “believe in themselves”. SLI crucially needs this kind of encouragement on his suggestive function, but he can get it only if he is at least normatively successful and accomplished. To achieve this, SLI needs to “cut the wings” of his competitors and “undercut” his critics and opponents during disputes, and to be able to pull wool over their eyes, inflating both the actual and the imagined self-value, referring to his reluctance to chase mirages but also refusing to pursue realistic and achievable goals. And in all of this (in the case when he runs into ambitious and stupid “fans”, who obstinately and rudely impose foreign to him goals) he is helped by “the game of the fox and the grapes”, by which he can also persistently and stubbornly defend his modest and moderate positions.",
									"Many members of Delta Quadra resort to such protective measures (moderation and caution) in regard to themselves - with the exception of LSE, Stierlitz, whose passions hobbies and ambitious creative plans, the pursuit of excellence, high quality of the work, and expansion of limits of the possible, are all paramount (+Te↑) and often constitute the purpose of his life.

Even easier is to announce about one's rejection of envy and demand the same from others - to organize a “society of people who are free from envy” and “reach the bright future before others”. But this will be an imaginary solution of the problem, which again will come down to the same manifestations of quadral complex of “clipped wings”, to the protective measures for this complex brought about by fears of the inability to realize one's creative potential: “I don't grab stars from the sky because this is not what I want, but may be I will succeed in something else.” But this is nothing more than self-delusion, an attempt to outwit one's drive for creativity - “the game of the fox and the grapes.”",

They are imaginative but not always to any conventional means. They are efficient and productive but also quite scattered and roundabout; expending energies in novel directions with signs of promise or resonance with deep personal conviction.",

They will aspire to create an arrangement that allows for privacy, freedom and functional support. At their best, delta types will be keenly sensitive to the most ethically sound position, however obscure or unconventional, and find novel ways to organize their life to suit that ethical sense. They may also pioneer a new field of study, trailblazing into uncharted territory with the empiricism and mentality of a researcher and the heart of a child.",

A father may be an expert at tennis, with halls of trophies in his house and a CEO position, but have an aloofness toward his children; a lacking parental touch.

Yet, their fantastical energy can also appear tragic, as they radiate a raw emotional atmosphere which can be as merry as it can be pained.",

For these types, their energy will be a bit uppity and responsible, like the old librarian lady who asks you to keep it to a whisper. Or the strict inspector who leaves out no detail in the report.

Notwithstanding this aura, even conductor deltas will carry a somewhat humorous or witty edge to them, which accompanies their every word and gesture."

Given the nature of this problem, the theocrat begins to view language and reason as tools for guiding others towards sharing their context; language becomes a gesticulation toward the ineffable, a guiding of others' minds to gaze upon what mere words cannot capture.

							"Thirdly the second quadra is united by passionate desire to avoid danger -Ni(). They are set to prevent errors that have already happened before. In their midst experience, skill, sophistication are highly valued. They feel confident in extreme situations. The fourth of their values is organizational logic +Ti() which is based on their sense of duty, citizenship, loyalty to the selected cause. Therefore it is the most disciplined and organized quadra which is able to quickly gather all of the forces in a fist in the event of imminent danger or in case of extreme situation.",
							"From the quadra values follows its social role - the introduction of new orders and organizational structures in conditions of resistance of the environment. In history sociotypes of this quadra stand out as creators of states and empires, political activists who relentlessly fight for power. It is enough to remember Alexander of Macedonia or Peter I. Their purposeful energy is hard to resist. Overcoming obstacles with willpower - that is their mission. And they prefer not to defend but to attack. They enthusiastically sing of sacrifices and losses that are inevitable in the struggle.",
							"Psychological age of \"fire\" sociotypes is youth. The greatest strength a man has is in his youth when he is brave, active and impatient. He craves for action and self-affirmation. He needs a big task where he could realize his energy. He holds in his heart ambitious dreams of a brilliant career, major conquest, glory and honor. This fully corresponds with the worldview of second quadra. Its representative look young and strong, cheerful and beautiful, able to use their bodies well. In the yearly cycle they are corresponded with the most sunny, energy-rich phase - the summer. Summer time - time of accomplishments. Dreams and illusory plans of spring are left behind. The time has come for concrete action.”"

						"Victor Gulenko - Beta Quadra": [
							"Lets take a look at the second quadra, Beta. There is a type there that I call the “linker” - someone who links the quadra - a semi-active participant. During experiments it is easily visible who plays this role within a group. Beta quadra starts with EIE, the Mentor. This is the most revolutionary type in the socion. He is usually rebelling against some current system. At some point his rebellion becomes more forceful - he becomes almost as if obsessed - he teaches, proselytizes, demands to stop the old and start the new. Then he builds a new organization. It is interesting to note that building an organization is not accomplished by LSI as some think, but by EIE. Later Mentor burns out - breaks down, or become ill, or loses his sanity, or simply withdraws from public sphere. The sooner this occurs - the higher was the energy load of the type. Or in other words, the faster the clock is ticking inside him - the sooner he accomplishes the above. At the end he burns out, often physically.",
							"Next comes the implementer of beta quadra - SLE, the Marshall - the organizer, volitional sensing type. He pushes forward not with emotions, but with resources i.e. he finds resources for implementation. People have already been mobilized and organized (this was the mission of EIE) and now resources are needed to make plans and ideas materialize. Nothing can happen without sensorics. Information needs to be converted into energy, to materialize in some concrete things - this is the role of the Marshall. When he puts the right people in the right places and pushes all the buttons a breakthrough occurs - the old simply gets wiped out and replaced by the new with use of force. But SLE needs more and more to feel satisfied - he builds a house and buys a new car - but eventually all of this starts to fade. And it ends with remorse - late in life SLE comes to repent and regret it all. As a representative of second quadra he carries romantic values. Where is the main idea? He can turn to religion, start going to confessions or visiting a psychologist. This they would have never done voluntarily. It happens when they have already reached the edge.",
							"Then comes the stabilizer of beta quadra - LSI, the Inspector. Under Marshall's rule do not expect stability ever. After everyone has calmed down and all the posts have been distributed, the organization has been formed and supported with resources, that is when the Inspector slowly but steadily builds up a kind of system under some order. This is done very carefully, beautifully, with great clarity. Reputation becomes very valued. Good reputation is created for this new organization that emerged from the less organized system of the Marshall. For LSI reputation is very important - his function is to act as a humanist, to be good, to say the right words, to look intelligent. This is followed by dogmatism - the system petrifies. On official level this is called over-bureaucratization. On this stage the mission of inspector is over and he shall remain here.",
							"The corrector or perfector of the quadra is its fourth type - IEI, the Lyricist. This type is the bifurcation point - it does something to make the system transition to a completely different state, a more democratic one. This is what is called an “open society”. This is the mission of third, gamma quadra. IEI carries the key which locks the second quadra and unlocks the third one. He dreams of a better life, that all this totalitarianism comes to an end, strives to create peace. He rejects force. The system disintegrates - a sudden collapse then everything moves towards a new state. This can be observed experimentally - if an IEI is working in a group he will as some point halt this huge machine. It is simply amazing how he brings about this crash, unclear how this is achieved. Here again it can all start over again or move to third quadra. But nobody will leave voluntarily, especially from second quadra.",
							"By differentiating features trio gets the name of the second quadratic Central ascending aristocrats. Their generic name implementers because they like no other set plans for implementation in everyday life. Energetically most powerful Quadra, implementers capable of reversing the society.",
							"Due to its activity and aggressiveness vtorokvadraly always hit the center of any social dynamics. They especially rampant in government activities, as well as in the sphere of ideology and culture. Main carriers of “centrality” - a sociotypes Mentor and Marshall, who often act in concert. No such problems conquest that would not resolved this dangerous pair. They work well in the underground, creating illegal centralized organizations.",
							"implementers perfectly controlled directed energy flows. They are always on the rise, they do not accept defeat in principle. They are easier to kill yourself than to admit that their plans have the final collapse. Second quadra very ideologichna: it doubles and triples its unifying force due to their faith in the ideals for which they are able to self-sacrifice. implementers so efficacious in implementation problems because due to its emotional and volitional influence they involve radical solution to problems large numbers of people. Quadra implementers has extremely clannish nature. On a rigid hierarchy and drawn strong hand kept their discipline. Irreconcilable division on their own and others inevitably leads to ideologically and patriotically colored wars. Two quadra will not rest until the build authoritarian centralized state and destroy the opposition. Very typical for rulers Voploiteley cult and national heroes. End of the second period is characterized by the flourishing of quadra power of the state. At the same time the transition to the next era - tretekvadralnomu period, carrying with it the collapse of the state ideology and disorganization.",
							"Representatives of the second quadra you learn externally by mimicry of anger and intolerance that appears from time to time on their faces. Their facial muscles as it adapted to the expression of superiority and aristocratic election. Their gestures are either demanding, decisive, or prim-cutesy, like everything they do has a “make or break” point.

									[
										"1. “Aristocratic” trait (rational aspects are evolutionary, with a plus sign; irrational aspects are involutionary, with a minus sign: +Fe, +Ti, -Se, -Ni) In accordance with this trait, every person has the right 1) to create a hierarchy, establishing relations of subordination, to subordinate those below him and to comply with those above him 2) to support already established within the hierarchy traditions and rituals and monitor their observance 3) to put claims to the dominant positions within the system and to fight for one's right to occupy them 4) to fight for positional advantages in accumulation of rights, privileges, and opportunities 5) to establish one's own order within the system, consolidating power in one's own hands, to interact with others from position of power 6) to suppress by own authority, by authority of personal opinion 7) to control and critique the statements of lower ranking members of the hierarchy, limiting their right to expression on any (or on forbidden) subjects 8) to authoritatively impose one's own point of view, decisions, power, and will.",
										"2. “Decisive” trait (predominance of involutionary irrational aspects -Ni -Se) In accordance with this trait, every person has the right 1) to interact with others from the position of power 2) to interact with others from the position of advantage in rights, standing, and power 3) to use power methods to fight for an advantageous position within the system and have the right to put a claim to it 4) to operatively, in condensed periods of time, solve problems, his own and those of others, making responsible decisions and making others obey them 5) to win a dominating place in a system, to advantageously and operatively use own fighting qualities and particularities of the present moment 6) to authoritatively impose one's own will, decisions, and opinions.",
										"3. “Subjectivist” trait (predominance of evolutionary rational aspects +Ti +Fe) In accordance with this trait, every person has the right 1) to subjective analysis of events, opinions, and actions 2) to search for “the culpable” and displace them from the system, at the same time resisting being displaced, fighting for one's own place within the system 3) to contend the opinions and decisions of others and impose his own opinion as the final truth 4) to deliver his opinions firmly, sharply, unequivocally, displacing opponents out of the argument, out of the system of relations, out of the social system, and into the lower strata."
									],
									"In early stages of civilization, the era of the second quadra - is an era of fierce and all overwhelming physical power that is maximally respected, - it is an era that lays down the foundations for a reliable and strong statehood and further consolidates and effectively develops it, creating authoritarian and theocratic states, mighty empires, and mega-civilizations.",
								],
								"Fears and concerns that arise from Beta quadral complex.": [
									"From the combination of the properties of all predominant quadra traits listed above, in Beta Quadra society there arises a harsh struggle for power, for the dominant position in the system. Everyone strives upwards; all fight for the right of personal domination. Nobody wants to be on the margin or “behind” in this race. Everyone lives by the principle of “push and displace, so as not to get pushed out and displaced by others”, which creates a particular kind of tension in the existence within the hierarchy. Each pulls the privileges to himself or herself, each tries to choose a better part (especially when the resources are rationed). Nobody wants to get passed by when “the cake is served” and deprived of the benefits and privileges. Nobody wants to be pushed away from the “feeding trough”, ousted from the dominant positions - thrown off the pedestal, removed from office, unrooted from an established place, reduced in rank, forced into subservient roles, that have their own hierarchies.",
									"Beta Quadra fears that there won't be enough “sweet cake” for all, and those expelled to the lower levels will get a “stick” instead of “cake” - punishment instead of encouragement. In the lower layers of the hierarchy people don't survive - especially the sensitive and soulful individuals, for whom words “honor” and “dignity” are not merely abstract notions, nor “empty words”. Being forced to the bottom of the hierarchy means saying goodbye to one's dream and one's soul: the soul will be ruined, the dream will be spit on.",
									"Beta Quadra is afraid of:",
									[
										"having to part with their honor and dignity, a privileged position in society;",
										"being plunged into poverty, to a position without rights, being lowered in rank;",
										"being forced out of the privileged strata and thrown to the bottom of society;",
										"being demoted, deprived of rank, title, privileges and powers;",
										"humiliating reprisals and punishments;",
										"dependency on someone else's evil will;",
										"uncertainty concerning own social status and position, slander, libel, false accusations;",
										"afraid of collusions and conspiracies behind his back, of rumors, gossip, backstabbing, intrigues and betrayal;",
										"afraid of all that would obstruct him from surviving and restoring own social status under extreme circumstances.",
									],
									"Beta Quadra doesn't tolerate attacks on their social standing, on their rank, position, rights and privileges: they don't tolerate when their rights and rank advantages are being challenged, they don't tolerate familiarity in attitudes of others, in jest or serious, and can't stand ridicule that could create false impression of their inability to fend for themselves.",
									"Beta Quadra doesn't tolerate:",
									[
										"confusion in the chain of command and subordinate relations;",
										"departures from etiquette and protocol;",
										"disrespect for position and rank - deliberately derogatory or humorously familiar attitudes;",
										"infringement on their personal rights, goals, ambitions, desecration of their honor and dignity;",
										"misconduct, disobedience, insubordination, disrespectful or unacceptable behavior within the hierarchy, society, system."
									],
									"In resistance, in acts of disrespect and disobedience to their will, Beta Quadra (mainly sensing types) see a danger to themselves - an attempt to oust them from the system, to push them away from leading positions, which they counter with reciprocal aggression and respond with an affirmative push. Aggression for them is an effective form of expeditious attainment of desired goals (-Se↑; -Ni↑), an opportunity to seize power within the system*, to head it and keep in dominating positions, not allowing oneself to get displaced (+Ti↑; +Fe↑).",
									"By definition: heterogeneity of individuals in aggressiveness traits allows for all members of the community to self-organize into hierarchies; most aggressive seize power and remain on top of the pyramid, least aggressive - meek and compliant - get pushed into the lower layers of the hierarchy.",
									"Beta Quadra does not tolerate the destruction of the familiar and comfortable for them order of things, and cannot imagine existence outside of the familiar to them hierarchical system. In the absence of such a system, they seek to create an alternative hierarchy from a hastily gathered team (as it usually happens in a homogeneous, classless society, in schools, in institutions, in barracks, in closed organizations, in criminal world of pariahs and outcasts).",
									"The fear of being excluded from the system and thrown to the lower layers of the hierarchy, in this essay we will conventionally call the COMPLEX OF BEING SUBSERVIENT - being a person entirely dependent on the will of the dominants - the “second” person in the system, who may be very well the last within it.",
								],
								"The system of priorities of Beta Quadra.": [
									"Four aspects structure the society of Beta Quadra:", 
									[
										"The aspect of evolutionary logic of relations (+Ti) - Creates a subordinate system of relations, creates an authoritative autocratic system of power (“a vertical”). Brings order to this hierarchical structure, protects and supports it. Creates a foundation of rights under this “vertical structure”, creates “a table of ranks” and a system of rewards and punishments, defines the extent of rights and responsibilities, establishes a system of benefits and privileges.",
										"The aspect of evolutionary ethics of emotions (+Fe) - Creates ideological hierarchies that support the current autocratic apparatus. Creates a theocratic system of power. Sets prospective goals and targets for existing social structures, acting as their spiritual and ideological leader - “the forward” and “forward-looking”.",
										"The aspect of involutionary volitional sensing (-Se) - Creates new power structures that are alternative to already existing ones, spontaneously creates “a vertical” of power. Ensures combat readiness and defensive capability of the spearheaded system.",
										"The aspect of involutionary intuition of time (-Ni) - Tacitly and unnoticeably ensures the security of the system; in advance covers up the “rear points” of the dominants of the hierarchy, forewarns them of impending dangers, but can also replace them (discreetly and unobtrusively) if they are recognized as weak and incompetent leaders."
									],
								],
								"The fate of the marginalized and the outcasts in Beta Quadra.": [
									"Due to the harsh and uncompromising struggle for power, in Beta Quadra it is shameful and dangerous to be weak - the weak are always to blame already by the fact that they are weak, always and everywhere a nuisance as the vulnerable and burdensome (and therefore unneeded) link in the system. The weak are always pushed out. The weak are already in the wrong by the fact that they have allowed themselves to get displaced. The weak person has no strength to stand up for himself, no strength to “get heard by the judges”, no strength to defend his honor and to prove his rightness in an argument or with arms in a duel. And of course, the weak person is powerless to resist collective hounding, collective pressure and collusion.",
									"To disempower the strong (“by hook or by crook” - if not by strength then by tenacity), to make the strong weak and push them out of the system - is the “easiest” method to deal with competition - the most “invisible” and “unobtrusive” way. The “guilty” one will be whoever is weak, not the one who has made him so.",
									"The fate of the weak is unenviable in the society of Beta Quadra. The weak is doomed to extinction, to the role of a victim of social contempt, condemned to expulsion from the system to the bottom of society - into “the waste material”, into “the re-sorting pile” - to the position of a pariah, an outcast, an errand-boy. And from this fate no one is immune in Beta Quadra, and no one wishes it upon himself. Due to this, Beta Quadra members maximally employ most combat-worthy features and qualities of their TIMs - the will to win, ruthlessness towards the enemy, determination, perseverance, sense of goal or purpose, and tenacity. Under any conditions one needs to be able to live, to survive, to raise a family, to defend one's rights and interests, and be able to fight for them, to set ambitious goals and know how to reach them.",
									"Practiced for centuries, tempered and honed in struggles, the willful competitive qualities of the dominant here TIMs allow Beta Quadra to be environmentally successful under any conditions - under any dictatorship, under any changes of ruling powers to strive upward, to occupy advantageous places in a society, to protect themselves and their interests. Those who cannot or do not wish to do so, end up in subservient positions, as pariahs, and become “blameworthy of their own misfortunes”, do not evoke any pity and compassion, but become an instructive example for others - an example of whom not to be in the authoritarian society of Beta Quadra, whose fate and whose example is not to be repeated.",
									"In Beta Quadra it is dangerous to become “the guilty one”. The “guilty” person pays for everything and for everyone - he takes on the blame for all the misfortunes that befell his companions. He is put before a maximum of charges from all that could be possibly presented (no matter how absurd they may seem), so that later on, with the combination of all these “crimes”, he can be condemned for everything at once, with a maximum of austerity “to discourage others”. The “guilty” person turns into a “scapegoat” in the full sense of the word: if someone has some sins of their soul or wrongdoings on their conscience, they all unabashedly dump them on him, and he gets blamed for all the atrocities and wrong-doings - today he's the “hero of the day” and none want to take his place at the “pillar of shame”. At the same time, he's not allowed to justify himself - for he may try to shift his blame on the shoulders of others or point to his associates among them. So it is better that he keeps silent under the weight of all the charges - others still need to live on, and for him it no longer matters, as he's going to perish in any case: “Seven problems - one answer,” - so does it matter what kind of misdeed he will be paying for? He is to blame by the sheer fact that he is “caught”, that he turned out to be the “fool” and the “weak one” who succumbed to the onslaught, did not manage to divert suspicions and was unable to defend himself.",
									"The role of the “guilty party” is usually given to the “compliant” Beta types and representatives of other quadra, who, from confusion, accept the charges presented to them hoping that later they will be able to justify themselves. But this opportunity is not given to them by the “obstinate” and thorough (rational) Beta types: “The first word is more important than the second. You have to be consistent to the end. If you know even something, then you're already involved in it - and a suspect. If you got caught, then you're already guilty. If you couldn't stand up for yourself, you're to blame for it: you have proven yourself to be “weak”. And now you'll pay for everyone!”",
									"In Beta Quadra - the quadra of “decisive” types - it is very important:",
									[
										"to stand up for oneself in time (-Ni↑);",
										"to stand up for oneself proactively and resolutely (-Se↑);",
										"to operatively and in timely manner occupy the dominant positions (+Ti↑, +Fe↑), - “you snooze, you lose” and can be eliminated from the system as a pariah, “appointed” to be “blamed for everything”.",
									],
									"Thus in Beta Quadra it is very difficult to feel oneself invulnerable and protected. In Beta, a single mistake is enough to perish. Sometimes it is enough to stumble once to fall, and then never get up again. One disciplinary remark may be enough to get onto the “black list”, to become a candidate for elimination, to be dismissed “during downsizing”, according to “the will and the decision of the team”: “We have talked and decided that it is necessary to fire you - you are often late, have to travel far for work. We decided that this would be more convenient for all … ” - and this is in the best case. In the worst case, the person will go through all the circles of hell and all the stages of humiliation - because someone took note of him (he was “penciled in”) and wrote him into the “black list” of “terrible offenders” of the rules of the system. (The rules and regulations in Beta Quadra society can be savage in themselves. Suffice it to recall the brutal forms of administrative punishment for being fifteen minutes late for work, with a possibility of imprisonment of up to three years, widely practiced in the Stalin period in the USSR).",
									"“Selections”, “cleanings”, “purges”, displacements of the weakest on the principle of “push those who are already falling” are carried out at all levels of the hierarchy. This struggle for dominant positions burns with the fiercest flame in the elite strata. And the “guilty one” (the offender) in this system of relations - is a very important and much needed person: by perishing and dying himself, he “saves” others and helps them to remain in the system.",
									"The fate of a “pariah” no one wants for himself, but one can draw this part by lot. And so that “goods aren't wasted”, so that this person doesn't go empty-handed into nowhere, this part is made even heavier: “You already will perish, thus take onto yourself this sin, and that sin, and also that one.”",
									"The number of people that need to be “sifted out” in Beta Quadra society is often determined by a directive, in accordance with a “given plan”. So it was during the times of Inquisition, when, for the implementation of the plan of burning “heretics” accusations were made against young children who haven't yet learned how to speak. And no reasoning bothered the theocratic hierarchs: “What does it matter if an innocent child dies? An innocent child will go to heaven as an innocent!” Another version - and a famous statement made by one of the prelates of the Church: “Why try to distinguish the righteous from the unrighteous? Execute them all. The Lord himself will recognize his own!” (Of Christian charity and the seventh commandment “thou shalt not kill” they have forgotten at that moment.)",
									"In periods of all-pervasive repressions and “cleansing”, the society itself becomes a criminal and inhumane hierarchy. From the protector and defender of the right of its citizens, it turns into an “empire of evil ” that serves its own repressive (and regressive) apparatus of social system. So it was in the time of Stalin's repressions, when the “highest measure” (execution by gunfire) was applied to twelve year old kids. So it happens in our times, in countries with theocratic and authoritarian regimes.",
									"In the society of Beta Quadra, a person cannot not sense himself a potential victim, a potential outcast, “a candidate for elimination”. If he happens to forget about it, he will be reminded of it by the kind and good people from Beta Quadra - sincere well-wishers and friends. He will be taken aside and told: “What is this bickering that you have allowed yourself with the lecturer on political studies? Have you forgotten who you are and who he is?” And you can be absolutely sure that this warning will be provided only out of best friendly intentions: do not forget where you live - in what kind of society, at what time, in what kind of era.",
									"The fear of being repressed into the lower layers of the hierarchy does not allow Beta Quadra to become overly compliant and vulnerable, does not let them to relax and come out of the state of readiness, does not allow them to forget about the need to protect themselves and to deflect attacks aimed at them onto the “weakest links” - the most vulnerable and therefore “unnecessary”, “dangerous” and “burdensome” elements of the system, getting rid of which in advance is considered to be an appropriate measure. Such person gets thrown down, as a ballast, sent to “sloppy bottom”, weighed down by false and true charges, marred by his own and others' sins, passed through him is all the dirt that has stagnated at the bottom and all the “junk” that had accumulated in the bowels of the system.",
								],
								"Development of precautionary measures on quadral traits." : [
									"The fear of displacement to the lower layers of the hierarchy (quadral “complex of being subservient”) stimulates the development of methods and measures on the predominant quadral traits, in accordance to which:",
									[
										"On “Subjectivist” trait: Beta Quadra fears being subjectively accused - “recognized as guilty” on basis of a personal opinion, defamation, libel or slander, accusations of some real or alleged crimes or misdemeanors;",
										"On “Aristocratic” trait: fears not only getting pushed out of the system, but namely deposed, overthrown, thrown into the abyss, into the pit of misery and despair, of suffering and humiliation (thus Beta Quadra tries to quickly and firmly curb any manifestation of disrespect coming from others);",
										"On “Decisive” trait: fears any extreme and irreparable harshness of the expected punishment.",
									],
									"Propensity of the “decisive” types to act operatively, effectively and quickly, to be “brutal” and “swift” in retaliation (to act rashly and bluntly), allows for all possible and extremely harsh punishments for the convicted. In Beta Quadra he won't get off by mere ostracism (expulsion from the community). Penalties viewed as severe in Alpha Quadra here are considered to be too soft. In a closed and self-sufficient society of Beta Quadra the “enemies of the system” are not released into an exile (“this is too great a gift for them!”), but finished off on the spot, decisively and harshly, as a warning to others. Because too much is at stake. Namely, - the social and political well-being of the system, its combat capability and resilience, its unity and its solidarity - that is, all guarantees of its current existence and future development are at stake.",
									"“They that stand high have many blasts to shake them; And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces - William Shakespeare, “Richard III” - this point is also taken into account: Beta Quadra is afraid of getting carried away and moving too high, thus they don't try to “sit down not in their own sleigh” or “put claims to a place that's not theirs” (“every cricket has its own pole”), they try not to provoke jealousy and resentment in others.",
									"Reasonable and prudent members of Beta Quadra try not to make enemies. Or at least try to keep them in check or under control, in the field of view (“in target”), to be able to neutralize them in a timely manner. Choosing a convenient time, remove them from the game - drop them off to lower positions, marginalize them in a risky and dangerous game, lead them “to the monastery”, direct them under the wrath of the crowd, opening up a door for each and every person to blame them for all their troubles.",
									"In the ancient, archaic times, all the higher misfortunes that befell to a society were written off to such “marginalized people” - for example, the blame for natural disasters would be pinned on them along with accusations that they have “angered the gods”, after which they would be sent to the “gods”, be killed, which made an indelible impression on the rest of the community. Since the “gods” were soon accepting a sacrifice, the whole ceremony was heralded with such sophistication and celebrity, that in itself it was already an expected and welcome sight. Society wanted and needed this - it was addicted to the spectacle as if a drug and arranged for its procession effectively and theatrically - so that the audience could satiate its demands for revenge and hatred for the “enemies of the system” and get aesthetic pleasure from the kinds of punishments that befell to them.",
									"Later, in ancient Rome, all these spectacles were turned into a show. For the participants in these “performances” costumes were made, roles were assigned, and lush, richly ornamented “props” were crafted. For greater exoticism, regal animals, such as lions and tigers, participated, playing the role of the executioner. Society, depraved by such spectacles and constantly craving for some new, some spectacularly arranged entertainment, would make sure that the number of victims in the arena would not go down, that the flow of convicts “sent to death” would not decrease. At the same time, every person watching could justify these deaths by some or other historical or social necessity.",
									"Similarly, in recent times, the vast majority of Stalin's “conscious citizens” justified mass repressions, referencing the saying: “When wood gets chopped, chips and splinters fly”. Society was consolidated and actively cooperating with authorities in helping them track down the “guilty”. Informants (“secret collaborators”) of all ages were recruited from all walks of the population - from young and old, from students and from workers. First graders, who have just learned how to write, were made to draft “black” lists with the names of the “naughty” and “disobedient” children - those who would run around on recess, instead of politely and peacefully walking in a circle along the wall. (And how could it be otherwise? - let them know why they were taught how to read and write!) In those days, only the informants felt themselves safe, only they could say what they thought, and thereby provoke others to honesty. Each of them lived on the principle of: “You die today, and I - tomorrow”. And this principle is also fueled by Beta quadral “complex of subservience” - the fear of being forced out into the lower layers of the hierarchy - as a pariah, an outcast of society.)",
									"In such harsh and tough times, when one could perish for nothing, the “complex of subservience” would not only makes Beta Quadra be especially cautious and prudent in their views and actions (± Te ↓), but it also allowed them to survive in difficult situations, taught them how to value and get by with the little that they had been able to win in the fierce struggle for existence and a privileged place in the system created under such conditions.",
									"All predominant aspects in Beta Quadra work to mute the “complex of subservience”:",
									[
										"The conformist, autocratic logic of relations (+Ti) - the EGO “program” of LSI Maxim, postulating the principle “who has the power in the yard, has the right”, capable of getting along with any authority, and finding for himself a convenient eco-niche in the privileged layers of the hierarchy of any autocratic structure.",
										"And the heavily assertive volitional sensing of Beta Quadra (-Se) that forces others to subordinate and obey - the EGO “program” of SLE Zhukov, that is capable of pressing down with the weight of guilt an innocent person, and of suppressing an opponent by the gravity of his own authoritarian subjective opinion, leaving the last word always to himself.",
									],
									"Not yielding to them are their duals: EIE Hamlet, who fiercely attacks an opponent from the position of “obstinate” and authoritarian ethics of emotions (+Fe) - an eloquent orator, a consummate public denouncer, having no equal in this in the entire socion - the EIE knows how to captivate his listeners with ardent fervor of his statements, and does not give a break to anyone in a dispute. He protects himself fiercely and aggressively, saying things that sound extremely convincing, while in actuality having few “trump cards” or even in complete absence of them. That's who will defend his point of view to the very end, to the last breath, and will never consider himself guilty. Defending himself, the EIE always attacks (as is typical of an “obstinate” determined “strategic” type). If he cannot find an appropriate logical argument, he often gets personal, switches things around, and moves the blame to someone else's shoulders, trying to divert suspicions from himself. (Arguments of “decisive” resolute “subjectivists” are akin to a war - to win all methods suffice).",
									"Not far behind the EIE on creative ethics of emotion (+Fe) is the prudent and cautious IEI Yesenin (who is even ahead of the EIE on the “program” of intuition of time: -Ni). As a “farsighted” “tactical” type, long before the start of a dispute, the IEI thinks of a system of “traps”, “mines”, and “catches” that would disarm and neutralize an opponent. In a dispute the IEI remains by the sidelines. If the IEI doesn't feel him/herself personally attacked or challenged, he or she remains unnoticed, observing from the the sidelines. Following his intuitive program, the IEI can discreetly bring the opponent toward the “trap” at the right time, can baffle and slay him with glaring absurdity of his counter-arguments, turning a defense into an attack. As a “tactician”, the IEI works great on the defensive, and often seems invulnerable in a dispute, despite the fact that all of his/her supposedly devastatingly crushing counter-arguments at closer inspection look to be “woven out of nothing” - out of a “mirage”, out of “emotional foam”, from absurd conclusions and “soap bubbles”.",
									"Tempered in battles, the Beta Quadra does not allow anyone to push them out of the system, or even to its peripheries. All of Beta Quadra TIMs are protected (and armed to the teeth) by the set of predominating aspects in their quadra and in their TIM models. When Beta Quadra types are “on top of their horse” - in their own environment, in their element - they are often unapproachable. However, they often allow themselves to be defeated through a deal. There, where someone tries to “negotiate” with them and convinces them to admit to at least a part of the blame, in order to obtain for themselves (or their loved ones) an easier fate or a lighter penalty, they surrender. As soon as it comes to making deals, the advantages characteristic of them on the trait of “subjectivism” - become lost, as does the logic of relations (Ti) that gets displaced by pragmatic logic of actions (Te) of the succeeding Gamma Quadra (±Te↑, ±Ti↓) - the quadra of “decisive” “democratic” “objectivists” that displace Beta Quadra from their dominating positions by the use of new “trade relations”.",
									"In an effort to save and preserve more at the cost of a small loss, Beta Quadra agrees to conditions proposed to them (on logic of relations) and then they lose everything, as they find themselves in another system of relations, in a different reality, in a different era and under other circumstances - they find themselves in a pragmatic world of benefit and the calculation of “decisive” business “objectivists” of Gamma Quadra."

From the articulate and empathic FeNi, to the hypnotic NiFe, to the affable SeTi and the cool geek TiSe, we are drawn to their tailored presentation and confident aura. In their best form, their cultural know-how can lead to the creation of social cohesion, community, stability and equality. Like with alpha types, a strong sense of brotherhood/sisterhood may flourish and invite involvement between people of all demographics. But this acceptance won’t always come free. There may be peace and order but only in the confines of a certain paradigm which may carry superfluous restrictions and misconceptions about human nature.",
							"A type of sectism can quickly develop and an us-vs-them mentality stretches its root. When this hostility is at its worst, we will find opportunistic social and emotional exploitation, shaming, oppresive social hierarchies, bullying and misleading visions from oracle figures. But this stubbornness can find a source of relief in a feeling of cosmic embrace. When Ti and Ni collaborate to create an all-inclusive principle, sensitive to the empathy shared by all conscious beings, then the beta quadrant recovers its generosity and leniency.",
							"A sense of aesthetic will permeate the quadrant which aims for simple elegance and function.

They will carry themselves with a certain level of density, and move in linear – rather than scattered – ways. Rarely will a beta type appear fully baffled or disoriented by a situation. And when the beta type does experience confusion, it will more commonly manifest as frustration and impatience with a situation that feels needlessly convoluted.",
							"Betas will also have a somatic aura, with a keen sense of presence. The word gritty encapsulates a variation of beta which focuses on the tactile and competitive duality of Se+Fe, leading them to be motivated by various forms of contact. Another variation of beta can be described as angsty. This variation is defined by a directive Fe in chronic opposition to some element of the human world, conjoined with an Ni worldview which may offer a rather bleak estimation of the possibility for solutions. In better circumstances, betas will have a playful and zesty energy which riffs off the present in a vibrant way, causing them to have a charming aura and infectious spirit."

This position leads to the codification of universally consistent laws or standards, meant to account for every possible context.

They are always driven towards all different directions, living in wait of some new and interesting information wherever it may come from. They are very entertaining people who prefer an environment with informal communication. They are democratic by nature, denying any stiffness or over-regulation. These sociotypes are almost completely torn off from the ground and easily move to any branch of human activity. Narrow specialization is not for them. While in continuous search, they can become the center of the nascent vortex - a source of future storms. But they do not carry the storm themselves. The most \"stormy\" on sight seems to be Robespierre but in real life he is a soft and compliant person who only in his dreams creates projects of a fair state.",
							"Sociotypes of the first quadra when discussing emerging issues rely on their common values. Firstly it is -Fe () i.e. minimization of negative emotions. Avoidance of quarrels and scandals, emotional instability seems more important overall for this quadra than getting positive emotional outbursts. Secondly it is +Si() i.e. positive sensations, comfort. In an atmosphere of tension and strictness they are unable to fully realize themselves. Their style of work is characterized by relaxation, freedom, comfort. Relationship with external environment in which their activity takes place must be friendly and pleasant. Their company is always comfortable, relaxed, homelike. It is never rude or eccentric.",
							"Third value is +Ne() - perspective ideas. Therefore in the \"air\" quadra there are always talks about the future, the unknown, the possible. These sociotypes might seem as hopeless dreamers. And that is totally true: They tend to look further than anyone else - over the horizon, with pleasure they push for and discuss \"crazy\" theories. Some of those theories however are destined to live long. So long that they always outlive their creators.",
							"The fourth value of this quadra - global structural logic -Ti(). The tool that they always use in getting to know the world is a systematic analysis. They are primarily interested in the universal laws that govern the world. And all the traditions, conventions and limitations are dropped when doing this. Literally everything is subject for comparison, analysis and analogies. The main objective that they pursue is a comprehensive, breathtaking in its vastness and harmony unified view of the world. The idea of integrity, rationality and justice of all things permeates through their worldview.",

In places where such sociotypes gather new social, scientific and political trends are always born and spread that may in the future change the course of history.",

Their undying thirst for new perspectives and open-minded, uncomplicated view of the world allows us to compared this phase of development to the first season of the year cycle - spring. It is in spring that new life energy wakes and makes everyone know of itself. Spring is a time of hopes and ambitious plans that will come true totally not as planned.”"

							"The leader of the first quadra, Alpha is the Seeker, ILE, who finds and invents. Next, the implementer and disseminator of these novelties, who attracts attention of other people is the Enthusiast, ESE. This is the only sensing type that will readily engage in something new without pragmatic expectations, without expecting a payout, and the only sensing type that can do so for prolonged period of time fueled purely by its own enthusiasm. He does not want to do this, but it draws him in (Ne-HA). Social networks, meetings and parties emerge, at which there is not only exchange of information, but also exchange of energy - people communicate, share their ideas and emotions, exchange gifts and favors. ESE can breathe life into these abstracted ideas. This is the implementer of alpha quadra. The role of quadra stabilizer comes next. The system becomes unmanageable, so within each quadra there is a stabilizing type - this is the most evolutionary, the most even type. In alpha quadra, this mission belongs to SEI, the Mediator, which is so called because he always knows where there is a golden mid-point, how not to go too far either one way or the other way. Right now in Socionics this mission is not getting resolved. There are gatherings and social networking, but there is no unity, no stabilizing comfort, thus we are stuck at this stage. The next role is the proofreader, the corrector or perfector of a quadra. In alpha this is LII, the Analyst. His mission is reorganization and debugging. The maximum ILE can do is make a prototype, but someone needs to bring it to completion. Only LII can do this and turn it into a working mechanism. The second quadra is already waiting for a working model - they will not accept a prototype. Keep in mind that we are talking about a large group scales here. Each type has its own high and low points. Take a look at ESE. First he becomes acquainted with you, which is followed by a stream of positive emotions. Then he starts energetically running around, at which point you don't know what to do. Then he becomes underestimated, no longer appreciated. Then it all starts anew. Thus psychological death and rebirth occur many times within each type. Take a look as SEI. First stabilization, pleasure, relaxation - and then gradual fading. He withdraws into himself for some reason: “I am well, the rest concerns me little”.",
							"This process occurs like ticking of a clock. The LII will create a schematic and make plans, but in the course he will get replaced. This is instigated by sensorics and business logic - the weakest functions of this type - it cannot accomplish much of concrete and pragmatic value. Thus comes the next quadra. This is the bifurcation point - at type of LII. In any quadra there is such fourth, “perfector” or “corrector” type. At the point of this type it is decided whether quadra should end or continue on.",

									[
										"1. “Democratic” trait (rational aspects are involutionary, with a minus sign; irrational aspects are evolutionary, with a plus sign: -Fe, -Ti, +Ne, +Si) In accordance with this trait, every person has the right 1) to interact with others as an equal 2) to have equal rights and opportunities 3) to fight and contend for equal rights and opportunities 4) to freely express on any topic 5) to freely defend their point of view 6) to strive to defend their rights and opportunities by any means.",

								"Fears and concerns arising from Alpha quadral complex.": [
									"From the combination of the properties of all of predominating traits listed above, in Alpha Quadra there arises a fierce competition of views and opinions. Discussions, debates, arguments - these are the most wide-spread and most natural forms of approaching important issues here. Each person considers it to be their duty (a natural and legal right) to speak freely on any subject or issue, not limiting themselves to the means of expression in lexicon and by time.",
									"Each person feels the right to suppress the opinion of his or her opponents by his own arguments, forcing them out of the dispute, out of the audience, out of the topic, and out of the system. (Up to demands and exclamations: “Get out! There is no place here for the likes of you! First, learn to behave yourself properly and to hear out your opposition.”) While hearing out one's opposition, since no one here curbs themselves by time considerations, in Alpha quadra is also not liked:",
									[
										"out of fear that they themselves won't have the time to speak and direct the discussion into a convenient direction;",
										"out of fear of losing the initiative in a discussion, and that their opinions will be suppressed, their views - rejected;",
										"in nervous anticipation that they might forget the most important and powerful argument that can easily push out their opponent and support their own opinion (their own view, plan, decision, authority, goals, objectives, and so on);",
										"due to being afraid of being unheard or misunderstood by the audience, thus all start to talk at once, in discord: start suppressing the current speaker with shouts from the audience, by rushing him, by demands to step down and make way for the next speaker, by distorting his statements without listening to what he's saying, by mocking, jeering, banging fists on the table (here, everything is very “democratic”) - thereby drawing the time and attention toward themselves and away from the current speaker. May also say something crude, that is offending. May simply cover up his mouth or microphone by their hand, silencing him in order to calmly talk themselves. And all of these actions come from heightened worries and feelings of anxiety and fear about the inability to express oneself freely and in full. Not all those who wish to speak will be heard out - there's not enough time and attention for all."
									],
									"Alpha Quadra hates verbal attacks and censure that undermines their ability to get in a word. This fear that they experience - the fear of inability to speak freely, to discuss one's own topic, to defend one's own point of view - in this essay we will conventionally call the COMPLEX OF CLOSED MOUTH.",
									"Alpha Quadra is not distinguished by an ability to keep secrets. Here, any restrictions to disclosure are received with some discomfort. (Especially talkative in this regard is TIM ESE, Hugo: he doesn't make a secret of other people's secrets, but at the same time fears that his own confessions might be made public. Therefore, in a confidential private conversation, the ESE makes his companions promise not to reveal what he or she has told them.)",
									"Secretive people are not liked in the Alpha Quadra. They are not trusted, even a little bit feared - who knows what they have in their mind! (This is one root of their conflict with introverted negativists of Gamma Quadra - ESI and ILI - who are inclined to hide and not voice their private thoughts and feelings.) Another matter are those who are always overflowing with an abundance of news, sensational revelations, their own and other people's secrets - it is always interesting to talk with them and to spend time in their company.",
									"Talkativeness is a characteristic feature of Alpha Quadra. Debates, conversations, discussions - these are the favorite pastime here. Only try to interfere with them speaking, and you will hear: “Wait, let me talk to him - can't you see that I'm talking?!” At the same time, blocking the conversation, interrupting and interfering with other's talking doesn't require much effort from them, especially if to them the topic is interesting and relevant.",
									"The invitation to a conversation can be extended to and shared by all. Hence the characteristic habit of many Alpha types to find conversation partners everywhere, initiating discussions over important issues in crowded public places and talking with everyone present almost on any topic, trying to get their views across to their listeners, trying to maximally engage and involve the public by the conversation, becoming drawn into debates and pulling others into lively discussions.",
									"The search for a new topic, a new and interesting idea, is always relevant in Alpha Quadra. First and foremost this is true of Alpha logical types: ILE Don Quixote, and LII Robespierre: if only a small bit of a new thought is born, they immediately try developing into a new theory and publishing it. The requirement to bring every new idea up to the discussion here is observed unfailingly. Any deviation from this canon is considered to be a violation of scientific ethics: a new idea shouldn't stagnate, nor be hidden from the intellectual community - it must be made available to the society, it has to be discussed.",
									"Alpha Quadra types believe that openness and wide accessibility of information is their main democratic achievement. The level of democratization of a society here is determined not by the number of political parties (although here there may be quite a few!), but by openness and availability of conversations of any topic. (“Why belong to this party, if I cannot openly talk about it at every corner?!”).",
									"In Alpha Quadra, all value the opportunities to express themselves and to defend their views. Therefore, any divergence of opinions here get transformed into a real battle, where, with all kinds of efforts and tactics, by all truths and lies, one tries to assert their views and to attract the most attention. Once a person starts to talk, he or she attempts to capture the maximum amount of time while not allowing others to speak. If he succeeds, he may feel himself a winner (he's in the spotlight!), but in others this inability to speak and express their point of view evokes an acute fear of not getting heard - of being pushed out of the discussions and out of the process of debating an important and pertinent topic.",
									"Where does it come from? According to anthropologists, the vocal apparatus of human beings began to develop intensively 70 thousand years ago. It was then that the last mutation of the sphenoid bone at the base of the skull occurred, completing the formation of the vocal apparatus. Active verbal interaction has led to intensive informational interchange, and a rapid and intensive formation of TIMs. Consequently, there was an evolutionary leap in the development of human society, which has become much more coordinated in taking joint actions, more organized, and more prosperous.",
									"In the process of exchanging views, intelligence developed just as intensively, as did social consciousness and social order. New topics for discussion have appeared. Human species finally got the chance to talk to our contentment. (None wanted to sink back into silence.) Each felt himself a trailblazer, a pioneer in the fields of formation of new languages and new laws. (The claim that in the capacity for creative thought man may be equal to God was conceived in ancient times, among the freedom loving and intellectually emancipated logical-intuitive types of Alpha Quadra. The propensity for word-creation, for formation and setting of new principles, rules, and laws, for creation one's own languages and codes - still shows in them.) In the context of fierce competition of opinions, new leaders and elders appeared, who, unlike the previous ones, were not only strong and courageous, but also wise, able to think straight and to accurately express their thoughts, and capable of establishing reasonable and just order within the community.",
									"In Alpha Quadra there is a constant very fierce and lively exchange of views. Verbal expression, an opportunity to speak, to communicate - here is of the highest value: problems get resolved in the process of discussion.",
									"Due to the combination of quadral traits, the initiating evolutionary Alpha Quadra is the “most talkative” quadra in Socion. It's members, “Democratic-subjectivists” have the right to talk how they can, about anything they wish, and however much they wish it. In connection to this, a problem arises of mutually exclusive yet equal rights and opportunities for all members of the community and the need to link and coordinate them with each other so that no one is hurt or offended. To resolve these problems, just laws and regulations are developed in the community, the concept of norms is introduced, democratic forms of debate are invented. Regulations are set concerning speeches and presentations and the topics to be discussed. The position of a regulator is introduced - the “Chairman of the Meeting”. Disciplined forms of managing discussions are implemented, for example, the phrase “the permission to speak” (this expression has remained with us from the ancient Semitic languages), and notions such as the “the right to word” and “the right to voice”. And all this was done to ensure that everyone's opinion is heard, so that no one feels deprived of the opportunity to speak. All of such administrative and organizational methods and measures in the ancient and democratic community of Alpha Quadra worked to diminish and mute the complex of “closed mouth”.",
									"Alpha Quadra is afraid:",
									[
										"to find themselves in social and information isolation;",
										"to lose trust and respect (and ear) of other people;",
										"to miss opportunities to establish understanding with others;",
										"to miss opportunities to defend one's rightness, to justify oneself, to ward off suspicions;",
										"of giving any reasons for condemnation;",
										"of being forced out of the system, to be left without social and moral support."
									],
									"The knowledge that an important question will be resolved in absence of oneself, and perhaps not to one's benefit or favor, in Alpha Quadra provokes anxiety and fear. This anxious fear is compounded by intensive competition of alternative, mutually contradictory statements and opinions, that in their rapid stream drown out all of individual's attempts to defend himself, his reputation, his innocence, or authority. As a result, a feeling of panic arises, similar to the one experienced by people trying to “scream and shout to finally get heard by others” and yet not hearing a response, trying to find understanding with others and not finding it, trying to call for help and unable to do so for reasons beyond one's control - as if all of a sudden the person has lost his voice and is now sitting with his hands tied, with this mouth shut (or sealed with tape). And it's not as alarming and frightening that his hands are tied, as that his mouth is shut such that he cannot yell and shout to draw the attention and the aid of others, and to obtain justice, nor prove his case or defend his innocence, neither to consult or confer, or protect his honor and dignity, or to appeal to the common sense, conscience, and compassion of others - none of this can be done with a closed, clamped mouth, and this feeling in itself is what scares the Alpha Quadra members the most, plunges them into shock, into stupor, leads them to despair.",
									"To shout to draw the attention of others is a favorite method in Alpha Quadra - it's simple, ingenuous, yet effective way of drawing public attention, and with its help getting one's own way.",
									"An example:",
									"A five year old boy (TIM ILE, Don Quixote) was for the first time taken to barber's. (Prior to this, his hair was cut at home by his mother or grandmother; but now it was necessary for him to get a professional haircut). As soon as he was seated in a chair and wrapped with a napkin, he felt himself a prisoner, and when he saw an unfamiliar person with huge, long scissors approaching his head, he started screaming and shouting as loudly as he possibly could - such that it could be heard on the street: “Help! Help! Hurry! Over here! Help! They are killing a child in here!” The barber got scared and immediately put him out on the street along with his mother. He was taken to another barber shop, and there the same scenario repeated. To the third - the same. Desperate, the mother brought the child back home and cut his hair herself. It wasn't soon that he started going to barber shops."

									"As long as “judicious” Alpha Quadra has their mouth open, they are not afraid of anything: they will always find a way out of the situation, or at least call on the attention of the society and try to prevail over their tormentors with their help. Another thing is when their mouth is shut. The repsonse: “Shut up! Close your mouth!” - is one of the most offensive and humiliating to hear in Alpha Quadra. Especially when a person has something to say, but no opportunity to say it - which in itself is already offending, hurtful, and insulting, and, most importantly, dangerous in the “subjectivist” and “democratic” community of Alpha Quadra, where:",
									[
										"the one who has greater chances of defending oneself is the one who shouts louder - the prevalence of aspect of the ethics of emotions (-Fe) - or most convincingly proves his rights and rightness - the prevalence of aspect of the logic of relations (-Ti);",
										"all are divided into “us” and “them” (subjectivists);",
										"where everyone is trying to present themselves as “familiars”, as “one of ours”, and push out the “foreigners”;",
										"where there's not enough space in the system;",
										"where as a punishment one can be driven out of the community, deprived of the right to speak and to vote - thus expelled from the number of free and equal citizens, and transfered to the position of an outcast, a pariah, or a slave.",
									],
									"Therefore, for Alpha Quadra it is important to defend their honor before the public and in public places, or in the press, to set up some kind of “loud” scandal, in which they are able to attract the greatest number of witnesses and sympathizers.",
									"For example, ILE Don Quixote often quarrels with his “conflictor” or “supervisor” in the most crowded places - and arranges for something like a “public execution”, repudiating them with words in presence of strangers. For as long as there are other people near by, he's not scared. Subjectively believing he can count on their support and understanding, the ILE exaggeratedly and loudly defies his “offender”, trying to draw the attention of others and make them his allies. If one tries to rein him in, to tell him: “Shut up! Stop it! How are you behaving! You should be ashamed before people!”, the ILE, feeling himself in an awkward position (no longer a winner in the eyes of onlookers), immediately explodes and pounces on his “offender” with fists (in a final attempt to take revenge).",
									"To tell to an angered member of the Alpha Quadra to “shut up” - is same as pouring oil into the fire. Another matter is to accuse him of unfair distribution of rights and opportunities. Especially acute response such accusations evoke in the LII, Robespierre, for whom the leading “program” aspect of logic of relations (-Ti) does not allow to permit injustice in relation to someone else. To tell the LII Robespierre (next door neighbor, who protests against your singing at home): “You want me to live with my mouth shut?!” - as the LII neighbor will immediately feel embarrassed: “No, shudder to think that I'm forcing you to live with your mouth closed! I'm not asking for this - I'm simply requesting that you limit your musical training to morning hours.”",
									"Establishing a fair distribution of rights and opportunities - “the right to vote”, “the right to a word”, “the right” or “obligation” “to remain silent” - these are the prerogative of LII Robespierre on the aspect of logic of fair relations - his “program” function (-Ti).",
									"It is in “decisive” quadra that “silence is gold, word - is silver”, while in “judicious” quadra every word is already worth its weight in gold. Verbal agreements are of great importance here: if someone has reconciled and agreed in words - they can be considered to be reconciled in business, especially if reconciliation was organized by LII Robespierre. Promises made ​​in LII's presence are difficult not to fulfill: he organizes everything very strictly and seriously, since on the balance of justice are the equal rights of two equally free in their opportunities citizens. The simple recognition of this fact already calms down the opponents and creates a sense of reliability, of guarantee in their relations, and of stability and order.",
									"As the complexity of social relations increases, exceptions to these rules arise. Verbal agreements and promises become insufficient (though the fans of catching someone on “idle talk” and old promises are still abound). Thus, amendments are made on previous agreements and arrangements. Verbal agreements and promises that were forced or made in absence of a person, in his place and without his consent, don't have any power and influence in this Quadra (the aspect of volitional sensorics is displaced (±Se↓)). Instead, the aspect of intuition of possibilities (+Ne↑) gets implemented in very ingenious ways: any loophole becomes used to its maximum, any opportunity to bypass or reject old commitments is set into motion.",
									"Any kind of trick or prank, any “evil joke” may be grounds for refusal to fulfill what was promised: “We promised - but we tricked you! It was all a joke!” (characteristic of the “joker” ESE, Hugo). If in response the person shouts, becomes indignant, loudly complains - it is still possible to change the attitude and fulfill the promise (of course, at the expense of other applicants). If he turns and go away quietly - it's his right and his problem: what was promised to him will be delivered to others. With his silence and acquiescence before bureaucratic lawlessness (unfortunately common in subjectivist quadras), he creates the conditions for even greater injustice - he creates a reserve pool of rights, privileges, and material resources to be given to others, those who loudly protested, yelled and shouted, who were stronger and fiercer in an argument, who were active in defending their rights - who can and want to fight for their rights.",
									"In the “subjectivist” Alpha and Beta Quadra communities there aren't enough material resources for everyone: there are always more regulators and distributors of public goods than there are manufacturers and producers of them. In Alpha Quadra, there are attempts to distribute the resources fairly (at the first stage), but later on - at the critical peak of “subjectivity” - in the hierarchical, “subjectivist”, “decisive” Beta Quadra the resources and privileges are given to the strong, influential, contending members of the community, as they become the “dominants” and form the backbone of society, the elite strata of the hierarchy.",
									"Of course libel and slander can also be used as the basis for refusing to fulfill a promise in the “subjectivist” community of Alpha Quadra. Anyone can say about the creditor: “I'm disappointed in him. He amassed his wealth in a dishonest way, and thus I won't repay my debt to him!” It's so much easier and simpler to besmirch a person and reject your obligations before him. And no one else will defend the creditor's reputation and insist on meeting the agreement if the creditor's own mouth is closed - if he himself is like a fish, standing there mute and speechless from indignation and astonishment, as if he was stunned by the butt of a axe, unable to utter a single word in his defense. Unconscientious (or insolvent) debtor here can show some more resourcefulness and ingenuity: stun his creditor further by 2-3 just as absurd arguments. Depriving him of the faculty of speech via surprise and indignation provoked by such arguments, the insolvent debtor can further make fun of him - to recall that silence gives consent, and try to win over the majority opinion to their side. He triumphs over his opponent's embarrassment: “Yes! He is silent - because he has nothing to say for himself! If he is silent he agrees with the accusations. If he is silent, this means that he knows he's guilty! …”)",

								"The development of protective and preventive measures that mute the fears of Alpha quadral complex.": [
									"The danger of being exposed and denounced further drives the forward momentum and offensive activities of Alpha Quadra. Beginning to speak, they won't stop until they draw the majority to their side. Even a short-term imbalance in power or pause from opposition is enough for them to claim: “You yourself have agreed with me - remember? You yourself have admitted that the truth is on my side.” This is often sufficient for “judicious” quadra members to insist on their own opinions: whoever yells and shouts the loudest, whoever is most proactive in an argument - that person will have the last word, that person is correct and in the right.",
									"And the best way of getting the last word is to try to “knock out” the opponent during an argument - to confound, to baffle, to stun him by absurd statements and conclusions, to “whack” him by false accusations and rumors, to tangle up his thoughts, his perception and feelings, to confuse and shut down his memory - to astonish and estrange him so much that he cannot utter a single word in response, not to mention try to defend his cause, to prove his innocence or correctness, and protect his rights - it is then, when he is silent and trying to regain an understanding of what is going on, that the “judicious” quadra member takes an upper hand in a dispute: “If he's silent, it means he is guilty or wrong. If he was in the right - he would have said so, proven his rightness, defended himself!”",
									"Losing the faculty of speech - is the worst that can happen in Alpha Quadra. To drive a person into shock, into stupor by absurd arguments or false accusations, to make him go numb from surprise and indignation - are all common methods of contention here - as old as the world. And these were quite successful methods in the early stages of development of human society: if one wants to have the last word, make it be the most significant the most substantial one. The predominant informational aspects and psychological traits that create four successful models of dominant TIMs in this quadra enable and promote this in every possible way.",
									"All of Alpha intuitive types (ILE and LII) are “static” and “logical” - they won't miss out on their rights (-Ti) and opportunities (+Ne), neither will they go searching in their pockets for a word - they can present their opinions very powerfully and extremely impressively. They can, better than any other types in the socion, astonish and disorient by the absurdity and illogic of their opinions that to an onlooker will appear to be very convincing and reasonable. (One needs to become skilled in having conversations with them to learn how to catch them on the illogic.)",
									"The sensing types of Alpha Quadra are the emotional ethical “declaring” types SEI and ESE - firmly convinced of their own correctness and able to squeeze emotions (out of themselves) to the maximum. Anyone who tries to argue with them will go hoarse from shouting, if not deaf earlier from all the noise. (Out-shouting Alpha sensing types is only possible to the orthogonal to them - conflicting and neutralizing - Gamma types, and even then with varying success.)",
									"The “declaring” “sensing of sensations” aspect of Alpha Quadra (Si) - is crude, rough, grounding and base (in its extreme expressions), and works to their self-assertion in a dispute. They aren't shy in sensory and emotional expressions - for too much is at stake: the struggle for material resources, rights, and opportunities, that are all scarce - this is a struggle for life or death. The struggle for survival here is not a joke: Alpha “program” sensing type SEI Dumas (+Si / -Fe) won't allow himself or his children to perish, but will fight for survival until the end; if not for himself, then at least for the sake of the children - and will stop at nothing if he wants to overcome his opposition.",
									"The “obstinate”, creative sensing, “program” ethical type ESE Hugo (-Fe / +Si) doesn't even need to be mentioned - having started screaming, the ESE won't stop until he overwhelms his enemy both morally and physically - he will instill fear into his opponent, break him by own determination and tenacity, and decisively defend his rights to the very end. The sensing aspect of Alpha +Si is a powerful weapon in a dispute, not to mention the overwhelming “declaring” aspect of ethics of emotions -Fe that blasts an opponent with heavy fire of the choicest expressions in the most fierce and gloomy tones.",
									"With the insidiously inventive aspect of intuition potential (+Ne), capable of blocking access to any proofs of innocence and vindication, and highly shifty logic of relations (-Ti), capable of juggling and stringing together the most intricate reasoning, and finding “inaccuracies” and “shortcomings” in the most rigorous and carefully balanced arguments, all of these properties work to dispel and mute the fears of the “complex of closed mouth” - they are the guarantees of personal rights and protection in Alpha Quadra in the opinion of society. The guarantee of the right, ability, and possibility for a person to fend for themselves on their own, merely on the grounds that if he doesn't want to his mouth won't be closed. And if someone wasn't able to explain and justify himself - then it means he either didn't want to or couldn't deny his guilt. From this follows that he himself is to blame: the blame is on him and it is so heavy that he couldn't even deny it.",
									"Thus, the subjective capabilities of a person become the objective reality (in quadra of “subjectivists”). If a person has failed to subjectively defend his opinions and his innocence, then he is to blame objectively and should receive a real punishment.",
									"- And what about the lawyers, advocates, and witnesses? - The reader will ask. - It is for this that here it is preferred to set up scandals in the presence of strangers, to have more witnesses.",
									"The ordering mechanisms of public relations have been historically created and developed in the evolutionary, initiating Alpha Quadra - the quadra of “subjectivist” “democrats” -- and subsequently passed to the Beta Quadra - the quadra of “decisive” “subjectivists” “aristocrats”, who transform subjective opinion of a person into objective reality, moving it up to a majority vote. If the majority of people (especially reputable people) tell a person that he is wrong - this means that this is the way it is, regardless of who that person might be.",
									"In the authoritarian Beta Quadra society of “decisive” “subjectivist” “aristocrats”, the people who make up the “unjust minority” were condemned as dissenters. Those who repented and pleaded guilty were exiled to hard labor, while the unrepentant were send to “fire” and declared hardened heretics. Even if they were very good and logical in defending their point of view, all the evidence worked against them.",
									"- Why?..",
									"- Another time - another system - other social conditions and relations - another quadra, other models of TIM, other complexes. What is accepted in one quadra does not pass in another.",
									"As we can see, the quadral complex - is much more that mere fear and anxieties. The quadral complex is formed by the aspects of the four dominant in the quadra TIMs - four eco-successful models that live in unison with this society and organize it according to their own views, adjust and mold it to themselves, reflecting and cultivating within it all of their priorities and preferential qualities and properties.",
									"Quadral complex - is also what defines and structures relations within a society, that which organizes it, sets traditions and practices, progressing the society towards a certain critical moment, and then leads it to its decline, to disintegration or extinction, causing one set of social relationships, predominant social programs and TIMs to become displaced by others.",
									"And how could it be otherwise? After all, all social connections - horizontal and vertical, all social relations - democratic and hierarchical, all the corresponding social programs, all the maintaining and supporting eco-successful social models and TIMs must be successively and effectively developed, replacing ones with others, in their overwhelming majority. This task is carried out by the social, interpersonal, and intertype relations, and the law of quadral succession. Not the smallest role in this is played by the quadral complexes."

In the four alpha types we find a special sense of humor which invites social participation and calls upon culturally known (and “safe”) memes. And since humor relies heavily on the unexpected, the more Si-heavy alpha types can manifest as being cliché and unoriginal in their socialization style. But if Ne is engaged creatively they may be great hosts and entertainers, surprising guests with their off-the-wall commentary. The alpha types will try hard to create harmony and will be quick to see solutions for social arrangements. They will be optimistic about avenues for connection, diplomacy and peace.",
							"On the flip side, these continued efforts to gain and maintain a positive social opinion may be overdone, raising suspicions of neediness and lack of personal identity. They may become social doormats, keeping their hands full with the troubles of others and the obligations they put themselves into. Their receptiveness to alternate ideas may backfire and cause them to listen too eagerly to information, especially if it comes from sources predetermined to be accurate.",
							"But this quadrant does have a special countermeasure to these shortcomings in their philosophical edge. In their best form, the alpha quadrant’s ideas will be constructed from axiomatic logic as it pertains to human nature; specifically coordinated at an improved societal architecture. They may be the idealists which remind the rest of society that collective opinions create the limitations we perceive as so unmovable.",

They will lack the final layer of polish – the wax coating – that Betas and Gammas so often have. This, combined with their desire to be shepherding at times results in a casual parental energy. Alphas, with their technical speech and history-referencing advice, create an aura that is informative but also earthy. Many may lead rather humble lives and develop an affinity for familiarity and community. Others may also make a habit of giving this parental advice and can appear naggy and repetitive. Their sense of diplomacy may add to them an equalizer quality, both socially and conceptually, as they strive for universal etho-logical convergence.",
							"For conducting alphas, their energy carries an element of stability and dependability. There is an appreciation for the time-tested and a level of respect for past lessons learned. For a man, we may sense a jolly lumberjack vibe: a brawny, earthy laborer. For a woman, the equivalent may be a stay-home mother aura or that of an elementary school teacher. And on top of this base aura will be a playful and silly energy which invites a level of acceptable spontaneity.",
							"For revising alphas, this unprepared energy will augment itself further into an aura that is speculative, open-ended and philosophical. The philosophical element of revising alphas, when prominent, will have crossover with the parental element of alphas and create a ragged professor. There can be a sort of historian or librarian energy to alphas, especially when the worldview function is strong. If instead the explorer energy is more emphasized, the alpha will be childish and quite malleable both socially and conceptually."

							"For the monarchic temperament, both perception and judgement are governed by personal context. To put it bluntly, this means that the universe revolves around them. The ultimate criterion of value is their own person: its needs, desires, and consequent goals. This aspect of their temperament transcends specific philosophies; both Ayn Rand and Karl Marx invoke the inherent needs and desires of individuals, and claim to be fighting for such. And, as Rand points out, this does not mean they are selfish in an absolute sense, since their own needs do not necessarily contradict those of others, and are, in fact, aided through mutually beneficial exchange (though, it must be admitted that sometimes such exchanges are impossible). Even acts of self-sacrifice can be the best way to fulfill one's own inner needs and values; the safety of a loved one, or even of a nation, may achieve such priority that the monarch feels compelled by a spiritual hunger to sacrifice themselves for its sake. But what they cannot do is see or act disinterestedly or impartially. They are blind without a particular context within which to operate, or a particular goal to strive to. And, as they know their own context best, it is likewise best to attend to their own goals and needs first.",

This quadra's perception is like water - a cleansed beginning. With its flow it washes away all of the dirt that has accumulated in the second stage. Simultaneously it starts to erode the foundation upon which the solid structure of second quadra was built. Water spreads over the surface filling cavities and cracks. Likewise the nature of the third quadra is characterized by variability, hidden reefs, inner wildness, hidden excitement, currents that are invisible from above.",
							"The third quadra professes its values. Firstly they refer to +Fi (). This aspect implies criticism of evil, desire to get away from bad people and negative relationships, protect themselves from enemies and adversaries. They want to minimize the negative experiences because all of the repressed issues as we know from psychoanalysis have to have an emotional response, physical payment for the purification of the subconscious.",
							"Secondly their intuitive value is +Ni() (intuition of the future). Suppressing their inner turmoil and short temper these sociotypes prefer a gradual move into the future though sharply rejecting outdated ideas and criticizing past mistakes and errors. Step by step closing by to the close, real future they generally believe in a linearity of development i.e. in their mind you just need to remove hindering obstacles, vestiges of the past and immediately in front of us opens up unlimited opportunities for growth. This quadra is not afraid of chaos and upheaval, they are able to act in situations of debacle, risk and confusion.",
							"Their next fundamental value -Te() i.e. business logic of risk and entrepreneurship. They are characterized by prioritizing rejection of useless, petty, familiar. This aspect stands higher than accumulation and rational consumption. Sociotypes of third quadra can successfully operate in conditions of economic scarcity when you need have to find a way out by using what might seem as useless at first but is available in abundance.",
							"Finally the sensory value of the quadra +Se() - resistance and opposition. This quality suggests that sociotypes of the quadra are able well to defend themselves and their positions. It is difficult for them to come to power as you have to resist the willful \"beta\" quadra but when they seize power they successfully keep it in spite of all attempts at restoring it. Security, ability to resist, not letting go of what is achieved is a principle that they respect. From these values naturally emerges social mission of the third quadra - cleansing which is to be understood both literally and figuratively. They restore outrageous or subject to distortion principles, doing everything in their power to remove obstacles and limitation preventing rapid improvement. Third quadra can be called a quadra of criticism and reform. In contrast to the \"fire\" quadra which is firstly oriented politically the \"water\" quadra is oriented socially.",

It is no secret that exactly when reaching the middle of one's life a person thinks deeply about how he lived before and by abandoning old stereotypes is able to drastically change the course of their destiny. Reflection on the journey from the heights of past years, evaluation of gained experience, collection of \"harvest\" corresponds essentially to fall - the time of the year when everyone can see how he worked during the spring and summer and what he objectively is worth. Fall - time of summing up and making evaluations.”"

									[
										"1. “Democratic” trait (rational aspects are involutionary, with a minus sign; irrational aspects are evolutionary, with a plus sign: -Fi, -Te, +Se, +Ni) In accordance with this trait, every person has the right 1) to interact with others as equals 2) to strive towards maximally possible creative self-realization 3) to freely develop one's business and creative initiatives 4) to fight for equality in rights and possibilities to creatively realize oneself 5) to defend one's own right to freedom of action and to an adequate response by action 6) to have freedom for enterprise, for making decisions, and for defending one's own point of view.",
										"2. “Decisive” trait (predominance of evolutionary irrational aspects +Ni +Se) In accordance with this trait, every person has the right 1) to interact with others from position of power 2) to operatively, in condensed periods of time, solve problems, his own and those of others, making responsible decisions and making others obey them 3) to decisively defend one's own right to labor, right to freedom of entrepreneurial activity and freedom of choice of profession 4) to resolutely defend one's own point of view, to advantageously and operatively use one's own fighting qualities and particularities of the ongoing moment.",
										"3. “Objectivist” trait (predominance of involutionary logic of actions and ethics of relations -Te -Fi) In accordance with this trait, every person has the right 1) to trust their personal experience - professional, pragmatic, business experience derived from personal observations - and insist on one's right to further act in accordance to it 2) to trust facts and to become persuaded by facts - to provide them as the main proof of one's correctness 3) to evaluate the situation by already transpired facts and to act in accordance with circumstances existing up to date, trusting one's own experience and one's notion of expedience of a particular course of action 4) to freely and resolutely demonstrate pragmatic initiatives coming from one's own base of observations, one's own personal and professional experience, and reasoning founded common sense, and at one's own discretion 5) to evaluate a person according to the level of his qualifications, based on facts of his professional training, attainments, and competence 6) to remove (or ask for removal) from work those who are inept and negligent, to push them out from work and projects 7) to fight for one's own participation in work or a project, for one's place on a working team, and to be able to defend it.",

The initially high levels of activity with which Gamma Quadra makes every new contact and gets involved in every new and exciting venture is quickly replaced by disappointment and apathy whenever Gamma Quadra feels that they have been driven out of a project, venture or work, when they feel an indifference towards their professional abilities and talents, when they are faced with objective underestimation of their creative force and drive.",

									"For Gamma Quadra there is no concept of “insurmountable work” or “impossible task”. Due to the dominanc of evolutionary volitional sensing (+Se) and involutionary (alternative) business logic (-Te) in this quadra, all work becomes feasible - if there is a wish to take on the project (+Se↑), then any task, any chore, any assignment becomes doable, once the right technological approach to resolving the problems is found (-Te↑).",
									"“Hunting is worse than captivity.” If there is a desire to realize the conceived, to bring the work that has been started to its completion, Gamma Quadra can fall hostage to their own will, but they won't won't pity themselves: the awareness of the necessity to bring to completion everything that has been started vitalizes Gamma Quadra, infuses them with strength, creates a sense of purpose in life for them, fills their life with meaning: one lives to work, to act and do something significant and valued.",
									"Translator's note: “Hunting is worse than captivity” - is a Russian idiom denoting taking on something difficult not from necessity but by one's own wish.",
									"If Gamma Quadra is left without a task, project, or work, without a way to apply their forces and strengths, without constructive goals, objectives, and plans, they start feeling themselves to be prisoners of circumstances, as hostages to aimless and meaningless existence. (As is often the case with forced unemployment during economic crises, or women forced to be housewives under complex social and economic conditions, in difficult or adverse intertype or interpersonal relations: “I'm glad to do work, but my husband doesn't let me!” (or when the woman doesn't get hired).)",
									"There is nothing more dangerous and scary for another person (particularly a conflictor) than to put Gamma Quadra types in conditions of involuntary unemployment and at the same time accuse them of being inadequate and insolvent, call them idlers and losers, blame them for failing to constructively apply themselves. For these kind of offense Gamma Quadra feel themselves in full right to spontaneously avenge themselves and make short work out of their abuser. Gamma Quadra types (especially, sensing ones, SEE and ESI) immediately lose control over themselves and will undertake anything to destroy their tormentor both morally and physically. (Such abuse Gamma types won't forgive to anyone!) Gamma Quadra will put to use all of their resources, all the materials at hand (up to sharp or cutting objects), but won't let the offender get away unpunished. The desire to put one's fists to use and beat the tormentor to death (or even tear him apart with bare hands) in such moments is overwhelming, thus the attack may be very brutal and fast.",
									"In any circumstances, Gamma Quadra defends its own (equally democratic) right to a harsh, operative, and effective response by action. The main thing is to have one's hand untied, then (unlike in Alpha Quadra) it is not necessary to call for anyone to help: one can deal with one's opponents directly, not even opening one's mouth to say anything.",
									"The fear of an impossibility to apply and realize oneself in favorite work, task, or project - is the most painful point of all representatives of Gamma Quadra. It is not recommended to intentionally wound and expose it: the consequences could be catastrophic!",
									"It is sufficient to place Gamma Quadra into such excruciating conditions even once (deprive them of work and respect) to immediately acquire in his person a new, deadly, and ferocious enemy, who is ready to take revenge on his or her abuser for life. Regardless of the differences in their position and privileges, regardless of being distant or close, of kinship and friendship ties, the abuser will be subject of his revenge. Everything else - is only a matter of time.",

									"Successful professional and creative self-realization in a favorite activity provides an opportunity to respond by action, by deed to the psychological terror waged by the offenders who attempt to lower self-esteem of Gamma Quadra. In is often the case that professional achievements of Gamma Quadra get ignored by the opposing Alpha Quadra (as “subjectivists”). Simply because this is inconvenient and of no benefit to them. Alpha Quadra (particularly ILE Don Quixote) will say: “I care not of your achievements. It's still unclear who is doing all the work for you! For me you are a nobody - an empty space!”",
									"Alpha Quadra kills by word, while Gamma quadra avenges itself by action - they will take something heavy into their hands and then adequately react in response. Alpha Quadra will consider its aggression to be inappropriate and unwarranted - they will loudly yell and shout, and call for help (as here nobody will try to shut their mouth) but Gamma Quadra won't get stopped by the cries of their offenders. The important thing for Gamma types is that right now their hands are not tied - and they can act and directly deal with their opposition here and now.",
									"Emotional pressure in Gamma Quadra is considered to be the most cruel form of psychological terror. It is considered here to be an “illegal move”, which no one should resort to under any circumstances. If the partner uses this “move” all too often, his demands become ignored, while his emotional state is no longer taken into account. Gamma Quadra becomes disconnected from this emotional current (as if turning off the sound of a TV) and calmly waits until their partner has had enough of the shouting and the hysterics. Gamma types allow him to release his “hot steam”, to overflow with emotion, while they calmly watch him, study his reactions, look at him as on a beast that is rushing about its cage, wait until their partner has had their fill talking, falls into exhaustion and calms down. And then, once the storm has died down, Gamma Quadra quietly attends to its business - starts acting at their own discretion, not particularly considering the wishes of the partner.",
									"Alpha Quadra types consider such behavior to be a manifestation of emotional stupidity. Gamma Quadra types are not interested in this opinion in the least: all that hinders their work, everything that stifles their activity and creative initiative, lies outside of any right-wise or ethical evaluations - the “tyrant”, the “despot” (which is how they view someone who limits their initiatives) does not have the right to appeal to fairness and justice, and cannot demand for himself any compassion, sympathy, and mercy.",

								"Set-ups over the complex of “tied hands”.": [
									"Being set up or framed over the complex of “tied hands” is dangerous for the Gamma Quadra. Such attempts make Gamma types feel guarded, since they lower their confidence in the sphere of professional and creative self-realization (and therefore “directly hit” them on the complex of “tied hands”). The most widespread of these “dupes” is “overwhelming and dangerous work” - if you carry it out, you'll die, if you don't carry it out, you will perish. This “overwhelming work” is often delegated by both “Aristocratic” Quadra (mostly by the supervisor types).",
									"Delta Quadra impose upon their supervisees excessively complex work in particularly unfeasible conditions, wishing on experimental basis to “test” or “develop” their creative potential, which is done in the interests of the alternative intuition of possibilities -Ne↑ that prevails in Delta Quadra.",
									"Beta Quadra will at times delegate to Gamma Quadra work that is dangerous, technically or physically impossible, which they themselves, for various reasons, won't take up, but will nevertheless offer it to others as necessary, serious, and important tasks. Sometimes they will offer it for ideological reasons: “Lead by example!” Sometimes they try to persuade of it's necessity: “Someone needs to do it!” Sometimes they delegate such work to test for endurance and loyalty and the proactive and constructive enthusiasm of the Gamma Quadra. Other times they impose it as an edifying lesson - so that they will understand that not all work and projects are for the benefit and enjoyment.",
									"However, to be a “small fry”, someone else's “errand boy” is not liked by the Gamma Quadra - here this is not considered to be work. Gamma Quadra doesn't take up questionable assignments - they are held off by the valued aspect of “ethics of relations” that supplies a high moral and ethical evaluation plank (-Fi↑) and warded off by the unvalued aspect of “intuition of potential possibilities” (±Ne↓) - “what if something happens!” Perishing for nothing is not sought nor wanted here. (With the exception of times when Gamma Quadra finds itself in a dead-end situation, already pulled into a dangerous venture, taken on a dare, etc.)",
									"Gamma Quadra types cannot do service for and before anyone (“decisive”, “democratic” “objectivists”). Gamma Quadra doesn't like entering into competitions and participating in contests and pageants (with the exception of the hungry for a venture, risk-taker and hot-tempered “player” LIE, who is easily drawn into contention) - they are afraid of accidents, which may interfere with their own creative self-realization (as a consequence of the repressed aspect of “intuition of potential”). Independent creative constructive work and being fully answerable before oneself and one's own self-interest - is for them the preferred option and course of action.",
									"Gamma types are very demanding towards themselves, yet they poorly endure external control and supervision over them and their work. They can't stand having to report before someone. (Especially before idle, curious strangers.) If close relatives or friends of the Gamma Quadra turn into “unbearably meddlesome fans”, strictly control them, discuss their actions and work at every turn, create a frenzied hype, during which they inadvertently displace them from the sphere of personal and professional interests, Gamma Quadra may break off relations even with them: the interests of activity/business are above all.",
									"The necessity to abandon favorite occupation for the sake of family (at the demand of the husband, for example) may serve as a cause of fracturing of family relations and a divorce. Gamma types are not always able to combine well their professional responsibilities with their personal and family obligations. There are often problems on the family front due to Gamma Quadra drive for work and activity, for the sake of which they may even leave their spouse (even dual one) rather than turn down their favorite occupation. To sit at home, with their hands folded, not being engaged in anything resultative and worthwhile - is the worst torture for Gamma Quadra types.",
									"Towards the society Gamma Quadra types have only one requirement: to be able to work from the heart and the soul - not out of fear, not from sense of duty - to work in supportive conditions for a decent wage or reward. The paradise for Gamma Quadrant looks approximately like this: peace, calm, favorable conditions and good, interesting work that would allow one to achieve the highest mastery in a favorite occupation.",

										"A four-year girl of TIM ESI (Dreiser) was in the kindergarten yard playing ball with other children. Suddenly she felt herself very bad. (As she later recalled, she was suddenly taken over by some frightening, “black”, suppressing feeling of an inexplicable, terrible fear.) She stepped out of the play circle and started to sob loudly. The teachers ran up to her to find out what has happened. Through the sobs and the tears she began telling them, repeating the same thing: “I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do!” The teachers looked at each other in surprise and began to reassure her: “How is it you don't know what you do? Come, play ball with all the other children!” The girl, still sobbing, replied: “No, not now, but when I grow up. I don't know what I will do then!” It didn't occur to her teachers to explain to her then that in the world there are many different jobs and professions, good and necessary, from which she will eventually choose one that is right for her. They simply sent her to a doctor worrying that she might be sick. A few days later the girl would still start crying and couldn't calm down. This episode she remembered for her entire life. From that time on, she thought long and hard about what she'll do when she grows up. In time, life has led her to an answer. It happened like this: she was in junior high school, when one night she had a terrible dream. She dreamed that she was on stage in a concert hall, announcing to the audience that she will be singing a song, but when she opened her mouth she suddenly remembered that she didn't know a single song in full. She woke up in cold sweat, and from that moment on new life began for her. Wanting to be prepared - if this terrible dream ever repeated in life - every day she started learning new songs (now she learned them from beginning to the end). She got herself a notebook where she wrote them down. She spent her pocket money not on ice cream, but on purchase of music notebooks and new collections of songs. Then she started studying music and singing. She received vocational training and after some time became a soloist at LenConcert and a well-known performer of old romances and songs.",

(Therefore, Alpha Quadra in intertype relations of conflict put their lives at risk when they make Gamma Quadra give up their favorite work in favor of family, and at the same time declare them to be “worthless windbags” or “unaccomplished failures”. By calling them “no one” and “nothing”, an “empty place”, Alpha Quadra creates an extremely volatile situation, and, not realizing it, finds itself on the verge of demise: being offended on their quadral complex, Gamma Quadra (especially the aggressive Gamma sensing types SEE, Caesar and ESI, Dreiser) will grab whatever happens to be at hand - something heavier - and use it as the most substantial and powerful counter-argument, giving little to no thought as to the consequences.)",

The only problem is that ESI's tongue (especially in dual relations) won't turn to call a person “a failure”, “a loser” or “an empty space”, even if the person deserves it. The ESI is much more willing to endure hardships and deprivations than to allow him/herself such tactlessness in relations with a person close and dear.",

But the same instinct forces him to constantly accumulate (collect, take over, or earn) the means for the new ventures, which are not always successful. Positive attitude provides for the natural optimism of Jack, his carefree disposition, determination, belief in good luck, in his lucky star. And in some cases - in his own exclusivity, in his high destiny.",
									"The thirst for new discoveries, new achievements, and new adventures does not allow the LIE to linger in one place for long. In the heat of gaming passion, in the pursuit of even more profit, he can drastically change his plans and get involved in a new, more costly venture, for which he can sacrifice the well-being of his family, the health and happiness of his loved ones. Stopping Jack from doing this is practically impossible: he doesn't recognize anyone's control over himself, doesn't coordinate his actions with his partner, and blocks his partner's activity by preemptively intercepting the greatest part of their total resources.",

									"Hernando Cortes (LIE, Jack), turning into a very wealthy man after his conquest of 25 million of the Aztec Empire, was so addicted to the search for new unconquered lands (acquired a taste of conquest) that he spent all the proceeds and assets from previous missions on equipping new military expeditions (it was nearly one-sixteenth part of all the treasures he captured from Aztecs). He spent all these resources on fruitless searches (by that time all the territory has already been captured), left his family (his wife and children) in Mexico City and returned to Spain, where, a sick and poor man, he died in poverty and obscurity in one of the slums of Seville (in 1545).",
									"The LIE is always afraid that there won't be enough finances for his plans and ventures. No matter how many resources are at his disposal, he will always try to claim even more - for a bigger, grander, more expensive project (if one is already spinning, then spin big time!). Thus, the LIE often experiences dissatisfaction with “small sums” and modest material means that are at his disposal, and tries to increase them the fastest and the most affordable way - through gambling or casinos. As a result, he loses all that he has - that which belongs to him and that which belongs to others. Then, for a long time, he tries to recoup these losses, to return at least that which was others' (or at least so he convinces himself). Then, he plays because now he can't stay away.",
									"It happens that LIE only pretends to be an “unlucky player” (or a “hapless entrepreneur”). He plays the role of a man who is desperately unlucky in game (or in business), but who desperately wants to get even (“take a rematch”). He comes home with a confused, embarrassed look and admits: “I'm sorry, dear, no luck today. Maybe tomorrow will be better.” And then: “I need money. Tomorrow I have to return a debt.” For the LIE this is a relatively harmless way to pull into his pocket most of the shared or family funds. That is, this is that very case when he isn't losing anything major, or he plays only for appearance and loses small sums, but in actuality he has an account where he is adding up and “collecting” all the new bits of income - saving up the start-up capital for his future plans and ventures.",
									"If Jack starts to “play dumb”, to pose himself as a fool, a failure, a klutz, a bummer - then he is scheming something not good and “holding” his partner for a “sucker”, turning over some scheme at his partner's expense (some material or financial machination) or even turning his partner into a victim of fraud. Because being a loser, a fool, a lazy slob in Gamma Quadra is just as shameful as it is in Beta Quadra to be a victim, an outcast, a scapegoat for someone else's guilt.",
									"Voluntarily, without a reason, no one in Gamma wants to wear the mask of a “simpleton” or a “fool”. Except for Jack. Jack often pretends to “be a fool” on his contact ethical functions, creating from his obvious and blatant “simplicity” a kind of bait for anyone who might want to cheat him, for which later Jack ruthlessly deals with the person - he “punishes” them for their “evil intents”. It's much worse, however, when Jack arranges this bait-and-switch for people who are close to him - when he comes to his family with this sort of a mask, joking and foolishly stumbling around, and at the same time constantly lying and creating drains of family funds.",
									[
										"But isn't his dual ESI able to distinguish truth from falsehood, sincerity from a game? Isn't Dreiser able to see through a person, especially someone so close to him?",
										"Blinded by euphoria of duality, the ESI does not see in the LIE anything except for what the ESI wishes to see. The ESI sometimes notices his dual's mask of stupidity, feels that he's being cheated, but doesn't always understand what is happening with his partner - doesn't always know what hides behind all this. Losing hopes of getting an honest answer from Jack, Dreiser starts questioning his friends, while they all have a mutual agreement. Jack is immediately alerted that he's being “watched”. Upon hearing this, Jack takes on the role of accuser and sets off at the ESI: how dare the ESI insult him with such distrust - this is so unethical! Blindsided and “knocked out” of his track by Jack's impudence, Dreiser takes Jack's guilt onto his own shoulders - Dreiser feels like a traitor to his own ethical program and tries to make amends for his wrongdoings, tries to explain himself before Jack, justifies his actions by necessity - after all, it is necessary to figure out what is going on with one's partner, it is necessary to resolve everything.",
									],
									"Listening to Jack's encouraging forecasts and his assurances that soon everything will change for the better (“Everything will be fine, you will see!”), Dreiser ends up exactly in the position of a “sucker” and becomes a “victim” of Jack's fraud with all the ensuing consequences. Jack won't be tormented by remorse (at the end of his “scheme”): in Gamma Quadra the “sucker”, the “dupe” is always to blame for his or her misfortunes. Besides, Jack quickly finds reasons to find fault with his partners and can easily justify himself: “She was too strict (or too careless) all the time. She deserved it. From now on let her be more careful. Fools should be taught.”",
									"To create an appearance of work/business activity for Jack is very easy if he wishes to do so. To sit at the computer reading some articles or stock quotes, to hang around different offices and centers in a new expensive suit, to drive to “meetings” in a brand new high-end car (bought with the money of his partner), to drive his partner to project sites and show the foundations of the new enterprise - all of this for Jack does not present much difficulty, to persuade, to dispel anxieties, to inspire someone to be more trusting and carefree.",
									"If the LIE puts his mind to a goal to get something - anything of value to him - preventing him from doing so is virtually impossible: the LIE knows how to achieve what he wants (“strategic” “decisive” “declaring” TIM). In any activity he knows how to find an advantage for himself (to convince himself and others that he's tracking his interest “for the sake of his future enterprises”). The LIE isn't one of those people who allow themselves to get cheated and he isn't one of those who allow themselves to lose out.",
									"Jack frequently changes professions, jobs, occupations. Recognizing in him a person without a particular professional orientation is difficult. And this also presents a certain problem in the dyad ESI-LIE. Sometimes, before embarking on another venture, Jack obtains permanent employment at some modest but good and decent job. However, he leaves it as soon as he meets the next partner who is of interest to him as “a potential sponsor” of his future endeavors. Once Jack establishes a close enough relations, he “suddenly” starts having “trouble at work” - some misunderstandings arise due to which some unfair demands are imposed on him (at least that's how he explains his dismissal from work to his partner). Shortly after this, he is overwhelmed by a desire for activity and entrepreneurship. He steadfastly refuses to take up steady paid employment and begins to think about forming his own company, about which he more of more often consults with his new partner. Immediately he starts feeling a pressing need for additional material means (for the beautiful life that he wants to create for his girlfriend there just isn't enough money). Jack starts developing plans for various future enterprises, ideas arise which he discusses with his partner.",
									"That is, at first, Jack does not appear to be a person without a specific occupation.",
									"But he becomes it as soon as his partner begins giving him money. In order to officially take possession of her property, he, not immediately (and not too eagerly), agrees to join her in marriage (even his dual partner). Emotions, romantic moods, dual euphoria interfere with such a relationship, where the main motivation is a pragmatic calculation, profit, benefit.",
									"Once Jack has established in a new place and insisted on “relations of comradery” within the family, with which material assets should be shared, he gradually appropriates one or another part of his partner's property. And then, “unwinding the max” and bringing up the need for new investment and new costs, he pulls in what is remaining. During this, his business plan is absent. Instead the LIE acts intuitively and tactically. According the level of the “spin”, he creates more and more scandals and hysterics about the lack of the necessary material resources. In the end result, he captures as much as he can grab. And then he disappears without a trace, leaving his partner homeless and destitute, with negative accounts, with outstanding loans to repay and a huge amount of debt responsibilities.",
									"Along the way, a question comes up - the reader may note - it is known that duals help alleviate each other's fears on “point of least resistance”. And fears on quadral complex - can the dual partner help to mute them?",
									"One's dual partner CANNOT cover for the fears on quadral complex, even during the period of illusory generosity that arises as a result of the euphoria of dual intertype relations. Due to this, each dual experiences a need to accumulate preferential rights with the subsequent depreciation of the rights of his partner (“a tug-of-war of rights and advantages pulling them to their side”). This is one of the intractable (yet) problems of dual relationships: each person has to make up for the absence of support on quadral complex individually, by himself or herself.",
									"The dual dyad “Dreiser - Jack” this issue is an especially acute one. Taking, signing over, appropriating into his hands all the material resources of the family, Jack actually deprives his dual Dreiser of moral and material support, and, at the same time, he deprives Dreiser of the right to self-determination creative self-realization (that is, deals a blow to the ESI on the quadral complex of “tied hands”), which is extremely painful for the ESI in itself and makes him/her regret associating with such a person. Having to choose between his dual, with whom the ESI has already merged souls, and personal creative self-realization, that guarantees ESI's solvency and self-sufficiency in the future, for the ESI is excruciatingly painful and unbearably hard. At this point, the ESI will have to forget about his own resource intensive hobbies, passions, and creative projects. Here, even the savings that he has made prior to the wedding won't help, as by that time they will be spent on “personal business” of Jack. The problem of meeting immediate material needs will arise. In solving this problem, ESI's dual will try to designate to the ESI the most unpresentable and slave labor heavy role. He will say: “Go on, dear, go work in a store or a market. I'll give the money for the first month's rent, and from there try to make ends meet yourself. This is better than sitting at home and writing music, which no one plays but you”.",
									"And this, incidentally, is a very real situation: appropriating all the money of his wife ESI, a very gifted and creative person, her husband LIE some months after their wedding told her to get a job at a factory (as there wasn't enough money to cover basic bills). When she refused, he offered her another option: to go to work as a trader at an open market. While she has two degrees and a crystal dream of peacefully and creatively working on the topic of her interest. Towards this dream, she had been saving money for a long time, which she, naively trusting her husband in the blind euphoria of duality, has given to him as her dowry (falling under the influence of the illusory generosity caused by mitigation of fears on “vulnerable function” during dual unions).",
									"Thus, the result was that the creative potential of LIE's partner has remained unrealized in this situation, although she has been saving for a long time the means to secure for herself a period of productive creative work, of professional “promotion” and a beginning of finished products, and material support for the family during her involuntary “unemployment”. But it all goes to ashes when instead of replenishing these funds, ESI's partner - Jack (a member of their “family team”) takes them to fulfill his own plans and ventures (which, for some strange reasons, don't bring him any profit), thereby depriving the ESI of her livelihood, and then telling the ESI to go work in an open market or a factory. On top of it, the LIE disappears himself, sells their personal property which he had already assigned to himself (as transport units for his future “enterprise”). Under such circumstances, the ESI is forced to forget about own creative work, about his own “contract with the muse”, which will have to be terminated (that for a creative person is always very painful), and go try to save the situation on his own. Until his dual again appears as if from nowhere and demands new subsidies for his unrealizable and costly projects - because Jack feels the very same need and has the very same thirst for boundless creativity and entrepreneurship - the same quadral complex of “tied hands”.",
									"Striving in all cases to remain in control of the situation, the LIE tries to control ethical relationships and model them in a way that is convenient for him, trying to extract from them maximum benefits for himself and his future plans. Wanting to remove all obstacles and eliminate all hindrances that arise on his way, LIE blocks professional and business activity of his partners, depriving them of financial (and therefore legal) support.",
									"Puzzling his partner and putting him at an impasse with his “wild” and “most absurd” escapades, the LIE often plays the role of an unpredictable, unruly person (with no reason in his head), who, nevertheless, dashes to undertake something, to keep up everywhere, to control everyone, to make friends with all, and to build relations in a clear-cut, organized, and spotless manner (despite his own chaotic and inconsistent behaviors). As a result, all that the LIE achieves on the level of personal agreements, he proceeds to destroy by his own contradictory actions, making an impression of an unprincipled, irresponsible, and dishonest person (especially when it comes to appropriation of the material resources of others).",
									"But this does not apply absolutely to all members of this TIM.",
									"Of course not. But the ever expanding window of opportunities, unlimited and boundless, in combination with improved conditions of existence create a precedent for temptation.",
									"“Today here, tomorrow - there, restless Robin Today here, tomorrow - there, and gone … ” - these verses of of Robert Burns, translated by Samuil Marshak, were and will be relevant for a long time. And “work” for himself such “Jack - hopper” will always find.",

								"Gamma intuitive types as victims of their own arbitrariness in business and interpersonal relations.": [
									"Establishing turbulent activity and intercepting both ethical and business initiatives, Gamma intuitive types, nevertheless, don't feel very confident in difficult ethical situations. The aspect of ethics of relations (+Fi) for them is located in their “child-like” Superid block as suggestive function for the LIE and activating function for the ILI. Ethical childishness, coupled with the quadral complex, often manifests itself in chaotic and disorderly actions with which they try to manipulate their partners, attempting to push them away, to scare them, then to puzzle them, to put them in a difficult impassable position and keep holding them there, forcing their partners to concede and comply with the convenient and advantageous for Gamma intuitive types conditions and circumstances. The less confident Gamma intuitives feel themselves in this alien to them environment, the more they bluff and with greater aplomb they do so, the more activity they unwind and initiate, the more absurd and haphazard their actions become, and the more harshly and despotically they try to submit their partner to their will.",
									"If to them the situation seems too complicated, and responsibility - prohibitively high, they, with a number of (seemingly) absurd, contradictory, and unnatural actions, try to inhibit and block the ethical and business initiatives of their partner, making their partner puzzle over, reflect on, and try to guess the reasons for this strange behavior, and bringing relationship to a standstill. Further, they shroud the motives behind their actions with even more mystery, making them further “incomprehensible”, while they evade giving explanations to their partner, and at the same time try stimulating interest in themselves, thereby “freezing” the relationship at some undetermined point and hold (“conserve”) their partner there, over this hopeless no-exit uncertainty for an infinitely long period of time.",
									"Being the initiators of such conditions, they don't allow their partner to leave the relationship either, but continue to encourage by word, deed, or at times an unexpected emotional outburst, confession or concession, or an unexpected friendly favor. At the same time, they watch the actions of their partner, keeping him or her in sight and the situation under tight management and control, waiting and expecting that it will somehow resolve itself in the most advantageous for them way.",
									"Sometimes they “open a second front” and in parallel create other, more favorable for themselves connections with other partners, in the expectation that their main partner, desperate to bring this situation to an end, will him/herself break off relations with them - leave the game, withdraw, and thereby save them from having to start a conversation about unpleasant and difficult topic. Subsequently (or simultaneously), on basis of pragmatic considerations, they may not let their partner leave and distance: “why lose a friendship with a good (and useful) person”. At the same time, they don't allow their partner to bring clarity to their relationship, entangling him by ambiguity of their intentions even more, and at all costs avoid providing any explanations: “it's a pity to hurt a good person”, “sorry to disappoint and upset him” “it's dangerous to make an enemy of him”. Fearing “what if something doesn't work out”, they allow their partner to become misled as to the true state of affairs, and keep him in the dark about the true motives of their behavior for arbitrarily long periods of time.",
									"As a result, their partner ends up being “bound by hands and feet”, entangled and tied up by a variety of moral and ethical obligations, meanwhile those who have created all this mess and confusion, the Gamma intuitive types, feel themselves free from any responsibility and act at their own discretion, not restricting themselves by any commitments nor tying themselves by anything. (And, if even their duals, “program” and “creative” ethical types SEE Caesar and ESI Dreiser, find it difficult to break from these clutches - even though as “decisive” ethical sensing types they are better than anyone equipped to break through such shackles (everything that they cannot unravel on their “decisive” ethics of relations (-Fi), they simply “cut off” as not worthy of attention) - then what is there to say about members of other quadra: they feel as if they are being pulled into a pit of despair and hopelessness by some kind of fatal combination of circumstances from which they cannot escape.)",
									"Moreover, all of these contradictory and chaotic (at first glance) actions they (the Gamma intuitive types) consider to be their unique exceptional invention - their own original and extravagant “discovery” in business and interpersonal relations, that they often resort to these measures to “muddle their tracks” and get to the needed result (to the desired goal) before others, thus attaining an advantage in time. They need this “confused mess” to “knock” their partner off the track - to confuse him, while they themselves remain “unsolved”, so that later, with greater rights and improved sense of confidence in their abilities, they could dominate in a situation that is too difficult and complex for them - to pull the levelers of control. The do so in order to safeguard themselves from all sides and feel comfortable - “to continue staying afloat and, at the same time, to have a solid foothold”.",
									"Even though from aside such behavior makes an impression of a chaotic, causeless fuss - of meaningless, “frog-like” “dabbling in milk” in hopes that in time it will turn into butter - Gamma intuitive types still count on a favorable outcome of events, that all of their efforts will lead to a positive for them outcome, to a point when they will be able to easily get all that they desire while being free of any obligations.",
									"By their partners, the Gamma sensing types, all of these contradictory actions are often perceived as a distress signal, as a call for help (help that Gamma SFs immediately rush to offer). But Gamma intuitive types continue to inflate their worth: they prefer to be “above” handouts. Not wishing to be bound by any moral obligations, they not only defiantly reject this help (for any service you'll have to pay), but also continue aggravating the situation with new chaotic actions, bringing it to an even greater impasse. The last word, of course, remains with the Gamma sensing types. Although Gamma intuitives do not allow them to come to a final decision - they will simulate a situation in which they portray themselves as victims of circumstances (for this they are “victim” intuitive types!) and obtain new resources, rights, and benefits in this game - receive from their partners new proposals and new “handouts”, which they, with the same defiant arrogance, will “reject” in hopes of getting even more generous offers.",
									"(Even the “program” and “creative” ethical types of Gamma Quadra - ESI and SEE - have to sacrifice a lot to their duals and activators in personal relationships, leaving these situations incurring huge losses for themselves and rather disappointing results.)",
									"Business partners of Gamma intuitive types may view this turbulent inconsistency as blatant speculation and profiteering on their friendship and cordial feelings - a shameless “inflation” of their own value, and takeover of moral and material advantages for themselves - and can consider this as “not playing by the rules”, as a disregard for teamwork and comradery - due to which, after one or several warnings (or even with none), Gamma intuitive types may be removed from the team and suspended from business (despite their best efforts in preventing this). That is, the very thing that they are afraid of the most (on the complex of “tied hands”) occurs: they fall victim to their own arbitrariness and find themselves being pushed out of business, out of the group - “thrown overboard” - as the ship leaves without them. Since they won't be able to realize themselves in this group, they are forced to seek another circle of friends, to look closely to another project and gather a different team.",

										"In connection to this a question arises - the reader will note - how does this turbulent, chaotic, contradictory activity on the whole relate to the “program” and “creative” business logic - logic of actions - of Gamma intuitive types?",
										"This is most puzzling to their business and dual partners - Gamma sensing types - when they try to figure out the logic of their actions, offering them assistance."
									],
									"The correct assessment of these actions can be given if we judge them by their result. Namely - by how Gamma intuitive types block the business and ethical activity of their partners by their own chaotic, contradictory actions, counting on the fact that their partner, the Gamma sensing type, seeing all this and fearing to make the situation worse, won't dare to undertake anything (even if it's the most active and decisive person), but will instead wait and hope that the Gamma intuitive type, at some point, will stop indulging in their whims and clowning around and deign to take up their primary responsibilities - that is, try to bring the situation of the crisis with infallible and operative actions.",
									"In ethical situations, they, as a rule, do not succeed in this.",

									"Getting carried away honing of his own “defensive capabilities” in the framework of the protection of personal freedoms and interests, ILI Balzac (introverted “negativist” “tactical” TIM) often becomes a prisoner of his own defenses.

As a prize, he appears to them as a sort of “fairy-tale prince, imprisoned in The Black Tower” - kind, sympathetic, but very lonely man, endowed with many good qualities and advantages.",
									"Following this, the ILI becomes a prisoner of his own loneliness, when after several long and fruitless attempts to “save” him many of his partners abandon all further efforts, considering this to be a hopeless waste of time.

Unlike the Betas, this polish doesn’t come from suave presentations or timely articulation. It instead emerges from their emotional independence, giving them a somewhat self-contained and aloof presence. Whether the gamma type is aiming to elicit this sensuality intentionally or not, a level of erotic radiation will emanate from them unbidden.

In the state of T, a person is drawn to the mysterious, otherworldly, and transcendental. In its extreme expression, the T-state leads to hallucinations, the appearance of various mystical visions. A person with a persistent T-state is most susceptible to hypnosis. Another manifestation of the intuition of time is feeling vulnerable to fate, lacking free will, existing at the behest of higher powers.",

The lifelessness of the body manifests itself in its fragility, paleness, and inner emptiness.

The movements in this state are uniformly slow and smooth. It feels like a waking dream. The eyes of a person in the T-state are very sad, they seem to reflect dim and mysterious \"moonlight\"."

These interpretations press themselves like sunlight upon the eye. Indeed, introverted intuition is more like sight than thought, since both are highly direct and yet technically subjective. You saw what you saw; no one else can confirm if you saw it alright. Thus, introverted intuition speaks in spite of others' views. Jung speculated that this was the function of ancient prophets and shamans, who insisted upon unseen but momentous things to come: zeitgeists glimpsed like leviathans, slithering beneath translucent waters.",

Each association is formed between objects, but because the objects Ne juggles do not need to be anchored to any concrete (C) analog, purely mental objects often become more plentiful in their thoughts since they are easier to create. The slightest attribute of the environment may trigger a caricature to rise out from a physical object while the actual object is henceforth neglected. The environment is still necessary for Ne to generate associations, but only as a catalyst which it can diverge from and handle the extrapolated material instead.",
							"This divergent property causes Ne to register reality in a very iconic fashion, where objects are often only attended to long enough to extract a caricature. This gives Ne a memetic approach to information, as each dataset it handles is more analogous to a meme than an actuality. Reality becomes emblematic, and suspended somewhat above the physical like a proxy or a series of simulations they can enter in and out of. This suspension from the limits of the presently concrete will lead naturally to an optimistic approach to metabolism.

The first stage of the intuitive process is accompanied by a painful feeling of dissatisfaction: a person cannot find a place for themselves while their ideas are hatching. An idea, it would seem, matures on its own. This slow process, however, requires an intervention so that the necessary images emerge from the subconsciousness. Eventually, this intellectual tension ends abruptly, replaced by relief and joy — the idea is finally born.",

You may see a frozen and unfocused gaze, muscles around the eyes getting tense, eyebrows being pushed towards the bridge of the nose, forming of the vertical folds on the forehead. The body freezes in a fixed position in which you are caught by an intuitive thought. Movements freeze and body sets into a position. This continues until the moment of epiphany, after which the static freezing is suddenly replaced by a turbulent display of emotions. A strong physical manifestation of the I-state is feeling as if swimming — immersion in water and weightlessness."

The individual's own dynamic and introverted Ne perceptions lead to a sense of sleepy drifting in them, which makes him welcome Ne impulses from another person designed to shake him out of it from time to time."

In the S-state, a person absorbs information from the outside world – sounds, smells, touches, temperature – and compares them with each other as a unified sensory complex. The difference from the state of F is that the emphasis is on the dynamics of sensations - on whether they are amplified or weakened, harmoniously combined or arise at random. In the S-state, a person does not think in terms of words or pictures, but through their whole bodies.",

Such a person shows themselves well when the external environment, perceived through the senses, is in a harmonious state. The S-type avoids activities that are accompanied by discomfort, noise, coercion, and prolonged exertion. Therefore, the task finisher is active in an isolated environment of the society. Although their activity is limited, it is universal and quite diverse – monotony and repetition are disagreeable with the state of S.",
							"On the psychological level, the S-state is experienced as pleasure, enjoyment, feeling sated, satisfying one’s thirst and hunger. In the S-state, a person expresses their feelings through giving care, an assistance to satisfy biological needs. This process can be compared to capturing an image on a photographic film, drawing a picture on a piece of paper, recording sounds on a magnetic tape, etc. The S-state can easily diagnose a condition: it allows you to determine the location of pain in the body and its intensity. The S-state is cyclical in nature – filling out and emptying of hollow organs and vessels with a circulating substrate.",
							"Physically, the state of S is recognized by a soft and relaxed body, a comfortable position in which body skin is in maximum contact with a supporting surface. In the S-state, uniform physiologically processes in the body become quite noticeable – respiration, blood circulation, radiation of heat. Gestures are sparse and precise, but smooth and without tension. Facial expressions are associated with engagement of the taste muscles located around the mouth and nose. Satisfaction or displeasure, pleasure or disgust are painted on the face."

							"This is the perception of what merely is, but as it is to the subject. The subjective conditions of the experience are emphasized to such a degree that all objective certainty dissapears. It is no longer important that something be impressive to others; it is only important that it be impressive to oneself. What others pass over as unimportant, the introverted sensor always takes notice of, due to their unique personal history with the thing. The introverted sensor's attention is not earned through flashy presentation, but through personal connection. One senses all that a thing represents for them, even more than they sense the thing itself. As the impressionist painter Claude Monet wrote, \"In Paris one is is too preoccupied by what one sees and what one hears, however strong one is; what am I doing here [on the other hand] has, I think, the merit of not resembling anyone, because it is simply the expression of what I myself have experienced.\"",
							"Truth is thus proportionate to the degree of its subjective presence, and a sensation is subjectively present to the degree that it resembles one of the subject's archetypal sensations. Introverted sensation abstracts from experience those elements it considers truly important, separating the wheat from the chaff, and forming a number of ideal sensations by which all new incoming sensations are understood. For instance, if both sensation types were stung by a bee, the extravert would focus on all that distinguishes the pain from other such experiences, but the introvert would focus on the similarities between related experiences i.e. where the pain falls on their subjective palette of abstracted pains. Everything new is related to something old and personal."

And since Se requires a concrete (C) analog to simulate a mental object, it does not diverge its attention from the environment like Ne but instead sinks more acutely into the physical world to extract out a greater volume of subtleties and datasets. This gives Se a photographic approach to information; a somatic registration of reality and a sense of presence. However, this sense of presence also makes Se more susceptible to the conditions of the physical environment such as through noise and irritants. This photographic focus is not easy to turn off, leading to a higher sensitivity to stimuli and a need to adjust to those conditions.",
							"Inversely, if the environment is providing insufficient stimulation, Se will compel the individual to take a more kinesthetic and mobilizing route of exploration and seek out new landscapes with richer details to extract. It will have a magnetic attraction to areas with the most pleasant and aesthetic frequencies. This makes Se’s exploration opportunistic, rather than optimistic like Ne. Se identifies existent opportunities for high stimuli in the environment, rather than being satiated with simulated potentialities."

							"Aspect: Affective motivation. People undergo an ever-changing kaleidoscope of emotion. These emotions can vary in nature and intensity, from happiness to anger to fear to solemnity. In each case, these feelings affect the bearer, motivating their behaviour. When expressed, emotion easily passes to other people, where it is felt in turn and passed on. As such, moods can travel outwards to include numerous other people, perpetuating a shared energy or feeling that can provoke or increase enjoyment. This emotional atmosphere can be participated in and contributed to, or undermined.",
							"Metabolism: The individual experiences emotions which they express to the people around them. In doing so, any need to express one's feelings is satisfied and the emotional energy of the environment is increased, leading to greater affect and involvement. In this way, how people feel can be moved and uplifted through public expression, changing people's perceptions and instilling passion. Similarly, people are brought together under these propagated moods, supporting the feeling being created and the activities being undertaken with those feelings.",

They will be confident in image-control, knowing how people respond emotionally to their behaviour, and making their communications more pleasing or to create a desired effect. In this way, the person will be good at getting a message across to others and instigating the right responses. [Applies to SEI, ESE, EIE, IEI, SEE, ESI, EII & IEE.]",

							"While being emotionally excited, a person loses objective rigors of judgment and plunges into the turbulent currents of their subjective preferences and feelings. Their consciousness makes very biased assessments, which are just an expression of perceived value for an object or a person. The thought process takes form of a speech rich in intonation, fast in pace, and lengthy in verbal content. Thinking proceeds as a dialogue with a real or imagined interlocutor.",
							"A person in a persistent E-state claims the social role of an emotional \"enabler\". Within a team, they pay attention to the mood of people and actively influence those around who deviate from the general emotional state of a group. The task of the emotional enablers, depending on the situation, is either to raise everybody's mood, cheer them up or to inspire, or to express negative emotions, pick on people, stir up some trouble. After having emotionally involved everyone in the productive process, the E-type switches to external communication — making connections with other teams and assessing the state of affairs in them. This second informal role is called the resource explorer.",
							"In psychological terms, the E-state is expressed as an exciting strong desire or passion. It can spill out in the form of turbulent joy or inconsolable grief. The E-user feels others like they feel themselves. This is the essence of empathy, which is so necessary for a practicing psychologist. The E-state is rational, that is, it is realized by a person, but it is very difficult to manage. Passion, whether it is joy or sorrow, is always one-sided: it concentrates all mental resources on one person or a group of people, so it deprives them of any choice in the matter.",
							"The physical clues that a person is immersed in an E-state are well recognized. These are wide-open burning eyes, rich facial expressions, quick and expressive gestures, erratic and impetuous movements, changes in complexion (suddenly turning red or pale). An ability to enter the E-state is necessary for anyone working on a stage and performing in front of an audience. The emotional expressiveness of an actor or a speaker is the main means of influencing the audience."

							"If \"feeling\" is evaluation (assignment of value, \"good\" or \"bad\"), then extraverted feeling is evaluation divorced from the subject and remarried to objective factors. It will never trust its own subject tom ake evaluations, fearing the narrowness and selifshness of personal bias. It is not interested in what seems good to itself, but always in what is good for everyone else, collectively. It therefore shares with extraverted intuition a highly democratic and compromising nature, settling on an averaged, commonly agreed set of laws (codified by introverted thinking). These laws are considered objectively \"good\" for everyone involved, and their goodness is confirmed through external feedback, i.e. through people's observable reactions. The extraverted feeler adapts their presentation to the cues given by their audience, and encourages them to openly express these cues, often by example. It is an open forum of feelings. They adapt themselves to produce feeling effects upon their audience, and their goal is an external harmony of feelings. The group's hearts beat as one. As Erasmus asked, \"You see your brother suffering indignities. Provided your own affairs are not endangered, your mind is not in the least moved. Why at this point does your soul feel absolutely nothing? It certainly must be because it is dead...how can any part of the body be in pain without your feeling anything?\""

With their work ethic, the P-users unwittingly pull everyone who communicates with them closely into their work rhythm. For this reason, workplaces designate such people as official leaders. The second side of the P-role in a team is to be a formal leader.",

In the state of P, a person experiences a rise in productivity, becomes energetic and purposeful. This state is very energy-consuming, so a person who is in it, gets nervous, has challenges with restraining self. Any distraction from work is perceived a useless waste of time and a loss.",

A person in such a state is quite inflexible and struggles to change direction. Having entered a P-state, a person completely gives themselves up to it, turns into a kind of machine of productivity.

There is no expression in it, but there is a long-term dependence of a moral and ethical nature. The R-state is a guarantee of fidelity in a relationship.

It can be detected by subtle misalignments of what is being said and minor disruptions in a normal way of communication. A voice may tremble slightly, the facial complexion may change slightly, the eyelids may momentarily flutter and quickly assume their normal blinking – all these are reliable signals of the R-state. Indirectly manifested likes and dislikes, attraction to or repulsion from a person, accompanied by a slight internal excitement, physically indicate that you are observing a state of R."

This generally takes the form of hard, abstract logic, which strives for consistent deduction down from certain premises. Once these first premises are \"bought into\", the conclusions must neccessarily follow; but this is, of course, the rub. One must enter into the introverted thinker's personal reality (by accepting their peculiar definitions of things) in order for their reasoning to make sense. No negotiation is possible beforehand; one must get on the introverted thinker's level.",
							"Introverted thinking, in order to understand something, must process it for themselves and reconcile it with their personal system. For them, facts are always allegedly so, until they can be demonstrated in a way satisfying to the introverted thinker. They will never say that \"Colonel Mustard is in fact a murderer\", but rather, \"If you accept my definitions, then you must accept that Colonel Mustard is a murderer.\" So wrote Descartes, \"Several years have now elapsed since I first became aware that I had accepted, even from my youth, many false opinions for true, and that consequently what I afterwards based on such principles was highly doubtful; and from that time I was convinced of the necessity of undertaking once in my life to rid myself of all the opinions I had adopted, and of commencing anew the work of building from the foundation, if I desired to establish a firm and abiding superstructure in the sciences.\""

							"When we use Thinking in an Introverted way, we get a mental image of the logical relationships in an entire system. For example, if we're crocheting an initial into a sweater, we're likely to draw a picture rather than work out the logical relationships analytically.",
							"Introverted Thinking is a right-brain form of judgement that makes us aware of a situation's many variables. When we use it, we recognize our power, as individuals, to exploit some variables at the expense of others.",
							"This kind of awareness is not only impersonal: it's graphic, immediate, and wholistic. It prompts no predetermined categories of good and bad. Variables that have unusual or perverse potential are accorded the same consideration as variables that assure a socially appropriate outcome.",
							"As a right-brain function, Introverted Thinking is not conceptual and linear [contra Extraverted Thinking]. It's body-based and wholistic. It operates by way of visual, tactile, or spatial cues, inclining us to reason experientially rather than analytically.",
							"The right brain, with its all-at-once approach to life, doesn't require exact predictability before it takes action. Its decisions are based on probabilities, and it leaves room for the random and the unexpected.",
							"These perceptions aren't peripheral. They're crucial to our intended effect. And they aren't reflexive. They're unspecified. As we're selecting and responding to them, we're not defining them and telling ourselves about them in a left-brain way.",
							"Introverted Thinkers understand reality only in terms of their ability to 'converse' with it, to take part in its 'becoming'.",
							"Unlike Extraverted Thinking, which is conceptual and generalized, Introverted Thinking motivates strategic action in a specific situation. When ENTPs use it, they don't start with abstract rules and apply them, step by step, to bring about a goal. They recognize themselves as part of an ongoing process, and they keep adjusting their behaviors in terms of the whole picture.",
							"When combined with Extraverted Intuition, Introverted Thinking can be highly cerebral, and it usually involves a complex imaginal pattern of relationships. For example, an ENTP might enjoy playing chess, because such types can usually anticipate the results of many potential combinations of moves. An ENTP salesperson might pull together a host of small details and recognize in one mental image how a customer is likely to respond to a product. An ENTP cultural historian might see how a seemingly insignificant detail in a popular movie actually defines the underlying ethos of a culture."

As Negativists, they work well with contradictions and paradoxes.",
							"Intellectual Sphere",
							"The essential distinguishing feature of the Dialectical style, is a view of the universe as a unified struggle of opposites. In speech it often uses syntactic constructions \"if-then-else\", the predictive branches of a developing process. Within limits, the Dialectic strives to find an intermediate point of dynamic equilibrium between contrasting extremes. Dialectical cognition is born from the colliding flow and counterflow of thought, the consciousness and unconsciousness. Thinkers of this style are characterized by an express inclination towards the synthesis of opposites, the removal of contradictions, which they so keenly perceive.",
							"Its advantages are obvious: it is the most subtle and flexible style. It can easily switch to an opposite direction, and possesses predictive ability, accompanied by an effective type of associative memory. Algorithmic thinking is also good at solving problems of classification, given their gift for recognizing complex patterns. Beyond the circumstantial conditions of a problem, it perceives a fundamental algorithm for its solution.",
							"According to Aristotle, Dialecticals prognostic thinking explains reality on the basis of purposive causes. For example, the cause of a sculpture is an idea of it in the head of the sculptor. The main role is played by a program, the intention of the creator. Thus, it can be considered teleological, and hence the most 'religious' in its essential thinking. Many scholars of this type sooner or later come to faith (not necessarily a church confessional).",
							"Social Sphere",
							"Historically, the first representative of a Dialectical worldview would be Heraclitus. Epitomizing the Dynamic dichotomy, he was of the opinion that \"you cannot enter the same river twice\" because whenever you enter again, the flow is already of different water. In more recent times it developed into Hegel's comprehensive theory of a rational system. Since Dialectical cognition, compared to other styles, is the most oriented towards creative intention, it invariably leads to ideas of a creator, an absolute, a cosmic intelligence, etc.",
							"Two of its representatives—EIE and ILI—are usually recognized in society as the most intellectual types. They form the backbone of intellectual elites, expert clubs, esoteric groups, etc. They are the best computer programmers, knowing better than other types how to work with moving structures—algorithms. Algorithmic diagrams consist of blocks and arrows showing the order of transitions, branches, and loop cycles. The crux of a program is its dynamic structure—pointers, rather than blocks. The formula \"if-then-else\" is, in essence, the core of any algorithm.",
							"The disadvantages in Dialectical-Algorithmic cognition include instability and uncertainty. Algorithmics suffer from difficulty in making choices and embracing unambiguous decisions. This thinking is more comparable to a symphony of flowing interwoven imagery, rather than a mechanism of clearly established instruction sets. Another problem is increased criticality, which can be so high that it incurs self-destruction, plunging them into danger of total detachment from reality, and leading to mental disorders, especially in cases of hereditary predisposition.",
							"Psychological Sphere",
							"The psyche of Dialectical types is most prone to transformations. From a psychological point of view, an unstable oscillating psyche is fertile ground for suggestibility. Occasionally Dialectics lose control over the parallel streams of thought fluctuating in their heads. They need only tune out their internal oscillation between freedom of choice and fatalism, and reinforce the latter. Doctors know that a small but accurately timed shock can throw the heart into a state of fibrillation. Likewise, a successfully directed signal at the right time can throw the Dialectical psyche into a chaotic state.",
							"The EIE Sociotype has a very suitable psyche for suggestive influence. It is characterized by so-called moments of imprint vulnerability. In these moments an intense suggestion is triggered—an imprint—the prerequisites of which are a state of extreme fear, confusion, or surprise. A 'No Exit' sign suddenly seen by a person of Algorithmic psyche at a time of severe emotional turmoil, may catalyze a decision about suicide. Exploiting this paradoxical nature of Dialectical types, shock therapy is capable of completely reprogramming their conception of reality, including core value judgments.",
							"A certain, although rare sign of Dialectical cognition—accidents that lead to states similar to a deep trance or coma, followed by sudden enlightenment or the appearance of esoteric abilities.",
							"The other version is slow suggestion, primarily based on entrainment through rhythmic vocalization and/or sound, multiple repetitions of the same phrase with variation. Variations in this case are particularly significant, working akin to the chorus in a song. Gradually a trance state is reached—external relaxation with internal concentration. The greater the monotony, the sooner a deep trance is reached. Hence why some people rapidly settle down and fall asleep under a monotone 'bubnezh' TV.",
							"Scientific Sphere",
							"Dialectical thinking best corresponds to the quantum-probabilistic worldview of modern physics. According to this paradigm, there are no immutable laws, only tendencies and probabilities. Quantum Mechanics is built on the counterintuitive principle of particle-wave duality, according to which microcosmic objects behave as particles and as waves. Two of the 20th century's greatest physicists disputed over this view—Albert Einstein and Neils Bohr. The former defended causal-determinism as the nature of the universe, the latter advocated a probabilistic ontology. In the aftermath, Bohr won. Though apart from its historical context, the dispute makes little sense, given that these cognitive forms are dual to one other. Jung's principle of 'synchronicity' also lies within the Dialectical paradigm.",
							"Contemporary British mathematician Roger Penrose has suggested that the human brain uses quantum gravity as a means for intuitive insight. He's written several books (\"The Emperor's New Mind\" and \"Shadows of the Mind\") stipulating that the brain is a quantum computer, and that Aristotelian logical thinking is actually alien to human beings. If he is right, it follows that the integral type of humanity is Dialectical-Algorithmic.",

After examining it awhile it alternately seems convex, with the top facing to the observer, then concave, with the rear wall receding into the distance.",
							"One more graphical illustration of Dialectical perception. What do you see in the picture: a vase against a black background, or two facial profiles on a white background? It depends on which one for you is the background, and which is the figure. Some see a vase and the profiles turn into a dark background, others see two black profiles and the white vase goes into the background. But once a person sees both images, fluctuations of attention begin. The picture seems to pulsate: you see a vase, then the profiles. There is a dialectical exchange of background/foreground. Triggering negative reverse perspective, where distant or darkened objects are perceived more significantly than those located closer to the observer."

							"“The fourth cognitive style: it is synthetic, positive, and inductive. Its most appropriate title is Vortical-Synergetic. This form flows in Sociotypes ESE, SLI, LIE, IEI. Synergetics—the science of how order emerges from chaos. The word 'synergy' in Ancient Greek means \"concerted action\". The concept of synergy continues to be discussed at present. In the West, it is called 'Chaos Theory' or 'Nonlinear Dynamics' [9]. For our purposes, it is important to note that it is characterized by so-called dissipative states—non-equilibrium, nonlinear, unstable. As Dynamics, Synergetics think fluidly with tints of one thought cascading into another. As Positivists, they converge towards a point of attraction. As Involutionary types, they frequently turn backwards and jump over previous levels, displacing the flow of their thoughts like a vortex or fluctuating storm. IEI as if in a kaleidoscope sees whimsical iridescent imagery, dissolving then receding in flux. LIE thinks very experimentally with many variants rapidly assorted and mentally tested on the fly for practical applicability. ESE initiates a social torrent leaving behind a trail of emotional turbulence. Thoughts 'swarm' and chaotically displace one another. SLI 'lies in a drift' as it were awaiting favorable wind. Once the situation becomes favorable, self-organization immediately takes hold and rapid thinking initiates, scrolling through incoming information, identifying options most and least likely to succeed.",
							"Intellectual Sphere",
							"Characteristic of a 'vortex' is its self-organizing nature, moving like a whirlwind. This manifests mentally as a rapid search for options, tests, and the subsequent screening of variants which do not yield results. It operates on basis of testing, advancing to the goal through trial and error. In a sense, it is comparable to a perpetual lab experiment in the brain.",
							"The first advantage of Vortical cognition—liveliness and naturalness. It seems to simulate the actual processes occurring in nature. Another advantage—faith in success and luck. Synergetics do not confuse temporary setbacks with error; they will undertake attempt after attempt until success ultimately comes to them.",
							"Its chief disadvantage is that the intellectual search is often blind and uneconomical. Another difficulty is its randomness and spontaneity. Synergetic intellect is a kind of chain reaction that catalyzes itself. The mechanism of positive feedback operates: if not curbed, then the concentration of effort first leads to an explosion, followed by dissipation.",
							"Synergetic intellect explains phenomena through substantive reasoning. The very substance (material or substrate) itself generating phenomena through natural movement. In the Aristotle example, the cause of sculpture is the block of marble from which it was made.",
							"Social Sphere",
							"Vortical cognition developed into a unique intellectual paradigm that was deemed later than all others to have social merit, despite it being most akin to natural phenomena. It is known that in natural conditions, all processes run in cycles. For example, in laissez-faire economies operating on Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' principle, natural cyclical fluctuations in market supply and demand guide the natural equilibrium prices of goods.",
							"Studying biological evolution, Charles Darwin discovered its origin as a struggle for existence against natural selection, and survival of the fittest organisms. The main engine of this 'evolution', is involution through events of random variation, which abruptly leave no intermediate gradual links between appearances of species.",
							"Biological self-organization is catalyzed by mutation—sudden, unpredictable changes in genetic material. Involution generates pulsating chaos, as evolution simultaneously selects and propagates useful mutations.",
							"Following in the involutionary trend of Darwinism, the concept of 'punctuated equilibrium' emphasizes the discontinuous development of species observed in nature. Authors Gould and Eldridge conclude from this fact that smooth gradual evolution of species is impossible under natural conditions. To survive, all organs must simultaneously be in working order; there are no creatures present with half-fin wings, half-hoof toes, etc. According to this theory, the lifetime of a species is divided into two unequal stages of duration. The first stage is stasis, long periods where no significant species change occurs. Then the second stage, a time of fracture when the species is rapidly converted into another form, or dies out.",
							"In the 20th century, as I mentioned, the vortex idea was rediscovered and Synergetics adopted its armament. The motto of Synergetics—order through fluctuation. Such fluctuations (local perturbations in the system) are analogous to biological mutation. Order in the chaotic evolution of complex socio-psychological systems, Socionics understands through the law of quadra progression. However, we must not forget that in the irreversible progression of quadras is a series of involutional junctures—jumps, twists, and turns. Because of this, the real non-theoretical quadra progression curve is jagged and looped, its outline resembling the dancing tongues of a burning flame.",
							"Psychological Sphere",
							"This cognitive style imbues qualities of endurance and optimism to the psyche. However, the psyche of Synergetics is less stable than that of Holographers. Synergetic types are partially conditionable, but capable of discarding undesired habits. For restoration of normal mental life they need specific, and sometimes long periods of trial and error. Depriving their life of continuous forward movement exerts a bad effect upon their mind. Operating principle: As ambient momentum of circumstance declines, their self-determination atrophies. Lack of oncoming circumstantial pressures renders them increasingly worse off.",
							"The best countermeasure in such situations is positive self-programming. Consisting of forcing disturbing thoughts to the background and dissolving them in positive scenarios. IEI before sleep visualizes a pleasant scene to remove disturbing experiences of the day. LIE casts a desirable goal in its imagination, optimistic it will eventually acquire the necessary persons and resources. ESE simply does not think about past mistakes and its mood is improved by itself. SLI is not the first place puts a positive scenario and awaits the moment possible to implement it.",
							"It is often forgotten that the synergetic aspect of development makes extended forecasts futile. American meteorologist Edward Lorenz descriptively coined this phenomenon the 'Butterfly Effect'. Where a butterfly waving its wings in some part of America can, with specific confluence of circumstances, induce a hurricane somewhere in Indonesia. Complex nonlinear phenomena are unpredictable, because tiny initial influences with time can lead to enormous consequences. In conventional life, this same phenomenon is called the Domino Effect. Where the initial fall of the first domino successfully entails catastrophe of the series. The catalyzing action, whose event occurs on your will, determines which of the scenarios will run—optimistic or pessimistic.",
							"Scientific Sphere",
							"This cognitive form reflects the synergy formed by the current worldview. Within this paradigm during the 18th century arose the Kant-Laplace hypothesis about the vortex origin of the sun and planets from cosmic dust.",
							"The Synergetic paradigm is opposed to Creationism; the emergence of complex systems explains spontaneous creation, not divine intervention. A typical example from the history of science is biochemist A. I. Oparin's hypothesis on the emergence of life from inanimate matter in the primordial 'broth' of Earth's early existence, which was largely confirmed in Stanley Miller's famous 1953 experiment.",
							"Also hailing from the Synergetic paradigm comes the outlook of Nikolai Amosov. According to him it \"explains the evolution of the world's self-organizing structures… miracles can happen, but are of no practical value.\" He sincerely believes demonstrative simulations can be recreated by computer models.",
							"Synergetics recognize the critical role of chance and free will in transitional moments of history. Synergetically-minded scholars frequently consider alternative historical outcomes. British historian Arnold J. Toynbee in particular, explored this twist on the course of ancient history—what if Alexander of Macedon did not die (pessimistic version), how would the world have developed then (optimistic version)?",
							"A real-life model of Synergetic cognition is the turbulent flow. Turbulence is a liquid or gas flow, in which there is rapid mixing of its moving layers. The behavior of such flows cannot be predicted. Whereas the preceding laminar flow phrase exhibits clear regularities deducible by Causal-Determinism.",
							"Mathematical modeling of natural growth processes typically uses exponential functions. Such functions describe geometric progressions, rather than arithmetic values. Logarithmic (S-shaped) curves terminating in saturation points are common in dynamic modeling. Implying that self-organization is not omnipotent: after exceeding a certain limit, it exhausts its own momentum. At which point it becomes necessary to either yield to external structure, or create a new nexus of self-organization. Synergetic types naturally select the latter.",
							"Lev N. Gumilev offers a Synergetic account for involutions of ethnogenesis in the birth, growth, and death process of societies. Social systems dictate rules of selection for specific behaviors of people. Charismatic-personalities (cranks, outcasts, dissenters) engender a variety of diverse social mutations. Society holds them at bay, until such time that it weakens for any reason (due to economic crisis, internal wars, cultural stagnation, etc.). Afterwards, the energy of a new order vigorously sweeps the decrepit system and begins to grow in its place. But sooner or later, the new order itself will age just the same and be forced to give way to an alternative system ripening in its depths, and so forth.",
							"Vortical cognition is hardest to convey to people of Algorithmic cognition, since to them free choice and the game of chance opposes teleology, fate, the special role of a creator, etc. When Synergetics speak about the implicit order in chaos, if we translate their words to the language of Socionics, they imply that Holographical cognition, with its minimally convoluted ordering structures, is dual to the chaotic vortex."

'Holograph' originates from the Ancient Greek words holos \"entire, whole\" and grapho \"write\". This name is derived from the Holographist's ability to densely pack information via method of 'like to, similar' analogy. Sociotypes possessing this form are SLE, LII, IEE, ESI. As Statics, Holographers attain reliable precision of thought. As Negativists they periodically turn the object of thought to its opposite side. As Involutionary types, they sporadically change the angle of examination or criterion of judgment.",
							"Intellectual Sphere",
							"This cognitive style has much in common with the holographic principle in physics. A hologram (optical) is a statistically recorded interference pattern made by two beams of light which are transmitted and reflected from a single source. Holographic technology allows us to obtain a three-dimensional image of an object. The hologram itself is an aggregation of stripes and spots exactly resembling the embedded object. The two beams of light are superimposed in such a way that every part of the hologram carries information about the whole.",
							"In this way, by mentally superimposing multiple projections of the same object, Holographists reach a holistic view. To do this, they look at the image and select a desired angle of examination. Holographic cognition often utilizes the grammatical conjunctions: \"or-or\", \"either-or\", \"on the one hand, on the other hand\". It actively uses the principle of perspective; unrestricted choice in point of view. The holographic approach is a progressive approximation towards the purpose, or away from it, accompanied by changes of perspective. The holographic process is carried out as if calibrating focus.",
							"Holographic cognition has a characteristic penetrating, skeletal-revealing, 'x-ray' nature. It unhesitatingly cuts away details and nuances, giving a coarsely generalized representation of the subject. Take for example the two orthogonal cross-sections of a cylinder: the horizontal section looks like a circle, and the vertical section looks like a rectangle. Two different perspectives of an indivisible whole which, when superimposed in the mind, produces transition to a higher level of understanding about the object.",
							"SLE thinks this way in battle. Analyzing the situation, they simplify it to two or three facets (frontal, flank, and/or rear), but then quickly go to a higher tier of understanding. LII grasps the problem from opposite sides, mentally rotating the situation in three dimensions around its semantic axes. ESI first draws near to a person, then moves away, seeming to probe the individual from all sides, cutting off those who could let them down. IEE detects the possible hidden motivations of a person, as if building their psychological 'hologram'.",
							"The main advantages of Holographic cognition are as follows. First, it is multi-perspective. As already stated, because of this it attains a dimensionally holistic and complete depiction. Second, it values simplicity and clarity, avoids pretentiousness, and forgoes 'bells and whistles'. Holographists are particularly effective in crisis situations, when it is necessary to make decisions quickly, and there is no time to weigh all the details.",
							"The obvious disadvantage of this cognitive style is that it appears too rough, lacking adequate consideration to details which become important when a process flows smoothly. Its information-dense constructs are often difficult to decompress and unpack; to outsiders, they may seem void of intermediate links for establishing coherency in their connections.",
							"According to Aristotle, Holographic cognition corresponds to explanation by structural or formative causes. Aristotle called it the structure of form. Returning to the sculptor example, the cause of the sculpture is its latent form, which the sculptor merely sets free by cutting away excess marble.",

							"A vague idea of the holographic concept was expressed by Gottfried Leibniz's \"Monadology\". His monad, a microcosmic reflection of the whole world order, is analogous to a hologram. Ecologists regularly turned to it in attempting to understand why there is stability in nature. Relationships between living and non-living nature arising in a given territory causes biogeocenosis, or ecosystem formation. Ecosystems are primarily characterized by equilibrium of self-similarity over time, where long-term coexistence of opposites without merging (synthesis) is observed. Therefore, Static prevails over Dynamic in such communities. Therein lies the fundamental law of homeostasis in the ecosystem.",
							"General systems theory was later formed on the basis of these ideas. It was founded by Austrian biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy, who introduced the concept of open systems, which exchange matter, energy, and information with the environment, thus resisting destabilization.",
							"While Determinists attempt to explain the behavior of a system by its component parts and interconnections, Holographists find novel qualities illustrating emergent features in it that cannot be accounted for solely from its internal structure. Therefore, the Holographical paradigm can generally be called a systemic-ecological worldview.",
							"Contemporary 'green' ideology is an epitomization of this cognitive form. This does not in any way imply that the ideologues of this movement are Holographical types—cognitive styles and proclaimed viewpoints may not necessarily coincide! Manifestations of one cognitive style through another are completely typical. The books of \"quantum psychologist\" Robert Anton Wilson are a good example of this, in which his Dialectical-Algorithmic form is laden with multi-perspective, holographic content [5].",
							"Psychological Sphere",
							"Holographical cognition corresponds to a stable, self-possessed psyche resistant to conditioning. In comparing the conditionability of an LSI psyche to its Involutionary Mirror SLE, observation shows that the degree of psychological resistance is much higher in the latter. How is this explained? By the durable cognitive infrastructure on which it is built. Complete panorama, which allows periodic change of perspective on the subject. Good balance between the immune and nervous systems, as well as the primary sense organs.",
							"In neuro-linguistic programming, this principle is used in a technique called 'reframing'. Reframing changes the perceptual framework contextualizing an event. If we mentally place a familiar object into an unfamiliar context, then significance of the whole situation changes. For example, imagine a tiger first in a jungle, then in a zoo cage, then on the balcony of your apartment. The standard Socionics type is depicted as immersed in its 'club'. But what if you shift it to quadra? What if it turns out to be among types with opposite cognitive styles? The chain can continue indefinitely.",
							"With reframing it is possible to see the familiar with fresh eyes. The type of the psyche in one who resorts to this technique remains constant of course, only their subjective relation to the object of attention is changed. The benefit of this method is primarily in the fact that new perspectives emphasize aspects of a situation that may have been previously underestimated, allowing the possibility of discovering new avenues of growth, and expanding one's existing range of choices.",
							"Scientific Sphere",
							"A real-life physical model of this multi-perspective intellect is the hologram—a superimposition of multiple images where each one can only be seen when looking at a certain angle. Change of perspective occurs intermittently and does not alter the system itself, only its priorities. In this way, multiple standards can be implemented, making it possible to work with a complex system as if it were a simple sequence.",
							"Another real-life prototype of Holographical cognition are fractal objects, discovered by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in the 1970s. Geometrically, fractals are figures with diffuse outlines, possessing self-similar internal structures. For example, trees, snowflakes, coastlines, etc. They are characterized by multiple internal forms similar in principle to nesting-dolls. Like a hologram, any fragment of a fractal contains complete information about the entire fractal. The part is always structurally similar to the whole.",

As Positivists, they aim towards singularly valid solutions.",

							"Causal-Determinist cognition is known under synonymous names as formal logic or deterministic thinking, both of which emphasize its rigid nature. Speech in this cognitive style takes shape with aid of the connectives \"because\", \"therefore\", \"consequently\" (causal conjunctions). The mental process consists in constructing chains of cause and effect, reducing explanations to deterministic mechanisms. Using the example of Aristotle, who first pointed out four ways to explain phenomena, the reason for the existence of a sculpture is the sculptor who fashioned it directly.",
							"In the scientific sphere so thinks ILE, in the managerial-administrative sphere is methodical LSI, in the social sphere SEE calculates chains of material interests, in the humanitarian sphere subject to the same categorical imperative is EII.",
							"Social Sphere",
							"Aristotle is considered the discoverer of this approach. The basic laws of formal thinking are outlined in his theory of syllogism. However, the first to consistently put them into practice was Euclid, founder of geometry. More recently, its principles grounded rationalist Rene Descartes in his 1637 treatise \"Discourse on the Method\". Then it finally took shape in mathematical logic. The Causal-Determinist paradigm reached its apogee in Logical Positivism, then increasingly began to decline in value towards the end of the 20th century. However, as the common stereotype of proof, it still dominates to this day.",
							"I will touch its advantages. First, it is perceived by society as the most authoritative, most convincing, and singularly correct. In mathematics, it is formalized as the deductive-axiomatic method. Use of it requires great intellectual stamina. Second, attributes of greater clarity and concentration are inherent to this style. The type most characterized by singular concentration is LSI. However, the irrational SEE argues quite soundly, deriving one consequence from another, implying focus on the chain of events. If even one link fails for any reason, then Determinists lose their sense of rationale and find it difficult to act because they see no reason to.",
							"At the same time, Causal-Determinism has its drawbacks. It is primarily the most artificial and removed from the laws of functioning life. Its efficacy extends to the 'logical' formulation of already existing results, the construction of operating mechanisms, but not fundamentally new discoveries. The first dead end which formalization risks is scholasticism, i.e. pointless albeit logically impeccable reasoning. The second intellectual dead end faced by sequential Determinists is the trap of reductionism, which they fall into on account of fragmenting wholes into their component parts. This deficiency was noted even by the ancient skeptics, as well as in modern times by Hume, who doubted that any event could be dictated by strict reason.",
							"Indeed, in building a long chain of cause and effect, it is difficult to avoid the danger of circularity, the risk of falling into circulus vitiosus—a vicious circle in the proof. Kurt Gödel's theorem on the incompleteness of formal systems, asserts that any sufficiently complex system of rules is either inconsistent, or contains conclusions that can be neither proven nor refuted by the rules of that system. This established limits in the applicability of formal logic. Using the deductive-axiomatic method, the medieval Scholastics in particular, attempted to rigorously prove the existence of God. Resulting from closure of causes in terms of effects, they circularly arrived at a definition of God as the thought which thinks of itself.",

							"Causal-Determinist cognition forges a mentality poorly protected from indoctrination, or in extreme cases, even brainwashing. By skillfully combining memorable words and actions, it is possible to gain control over the behavior of specific individuals. Intelligent Determinists in particular, are characterized by a strong dependence on the events of childhood, which Sigmund Freud discovered in his time, though poorly understood in full. Habits in pronounced Determinists are comparable in their rigidity to conditioned reflexes.",
							"Standard military interrogation procedures are designed to ensure guaranteed cause-effect impacts upon the psyche. It includes measures of exposure such as sleep deprivation, changes in room temperature and/or humidity, denial of food subsequently followed by its delivery as a reward, etc. Isolation of the detainee and the gradual imposition of regulations, bears fruit sooner or later. In time, the vulnerability of psychological destabilization is manufactured into dependence upon the interrogator.",
							"It is noteworthy that extreme critical situations, trigger a 'slow-motion film' state of mind in Determinists. Thinking becomes particularly clear, but stretched out over time, such that seconds can subjectively feel like minutes. Along these same lines, due to an abrupt shakeup of their psyche, the stress of surprise severely impedes their cerebral activity until they can recover in deep sleep.",
							"The psychological school of Behaviorism represents this model of the psyche. Its supporters believe that behavioral learning is achieved through reinforcement—rewarding adherence to rules and punishing their violation. B. F. Skinner formulated the principle of operant conditioning, according to which the behavior of living organisms is completely determined by the cause-effect of this conditioning. He proposed the method of 'successive approximations', in which students receive positive reinforcement in instances where their behavior conforms to that desired.",
							"Behaviorists developed the concept of conditioned learning and established a rigid procedural method of action towards the goal as the basis for its operation.",

							"Formal logical thinking in its time gave birth to the deterministic cause-effect worldview. This is the worldview of classical physics whose cornerstone is Newtonian Mechanics, and was the dominant paradigm until the early 20th century. Rigid systems operate according to these rules—organisms and mechanisms. When faced with multi-factor processes (such as psychology or society), however, reductionism loses its explanatory power to portray complex phenomena in terms of their basic components. Additionally, this classic paradigm has been too influenced by the ideal of 'progress', in spite of numerous historical examples of regressive tendencies, setbacks, repetitions, etc.",
							"A real-life model of Causal-Determinist cognition is given by information represented in the form of a chart or realistic illustration made using a direct perspective. In this technique, objects are depicted larger or smaller in proportion to their distance from the observer. By drawing in this way, following strict instructions, any object can be easily depicted."

From this standpoint we can understand the paradox when a Pragmatist may be among those who get behind (he simply does not understand why he needs all these abstract rules and formulas), but after school he becomes quite successful. The problem is that the school focused on mechanic learning of theoretical knowledge cannot understand usefulness of his practical skills.

The characteristic posture of the first matrix is precisely the contraction. If a person is just sitting on a chair, he collapses his body like a crustacean, closing from the outside world. If a person sits in a chair or on the couch, the poses become more intricate shapes, often the legs are picked up, which further increases wrapping. In this case, the body, as well as in the womb, takes all the different forms, folds and bends in any parts and in \"any\" directions. You can observe how the chosen legs are still wrapped around their hands.",
							"In general, the postures of the bearers of this aspect are always closed poses, the hands are joined, crossed or clasp the body, if the situation forces one to sit “as it should be”, it means that they are simply pressed tightly to the body. The legs are shifted or crossed, the body is fed back. Change of posture is a barely perceptible movement of the muscles, a person “shimmers” from one posture to another, and you can see how the movement is transmitted from one muscle group to another.",

In this subgroup everything is done quickly, but not abruptly, the environment of the fourth matrix implies that it is necessary to adapt to new conditions. Those. first, as if to try new conditions for viability and, getting used to them, unfold and accelerate.",
							"Muscle clamps, characteristic of rational introverts, are also present here, but not so pronounced. These people less than all others in the socion can sit without movement, more precisely, they can not at all. Stay in pinched poses, cramped conditions is most difficult to bear. Even the active third subgroup at the expense of statics - squeezing in the birth canal in such cases freezes, waiting for the “new wave”. For the last four spaces are needed, endless spaces, the pattern of these types of “new horizons opened up” and movement. “Joy is in movement, if movement is in joy,” it's true that people belonging to these types generate quite a lot of movements themselves, but it is under these conditions that the activity of the fourth aspect is most active, productive and comprehensive.",
							"Unconsciously, this is expressed in the desire to get into the new world and act there in its own way, so that no one interferes, no one overshadows the horizons. To open some new area of activity, a new hobby for oneself, and to open one's eyes in surprise: “There is a field not plowed in the same place”. It is these wide-open eyes from surprise, from delight, because it captures the spirit from the vast expanses, and distinguish the closing four from all others. Despite the high reaction rate, in carriers of this aspect, one can notice how, once in a new situation, a person freezes, as his perception changes. Sometimes this process takes place rather quickly and remains unnoticed by external observers and the man himself, but he is always there.",
							"To see at least somewhere in the gap “there is enough eye” is simply unbearable. Each representative of the latter aspect surely knows several places, from where a magnificent view opens up, a panoramic overview. This could be a ferris wheel, an observation deck of the tower, or a view from the cliff at the setting sun. In general, the attitude to the sunrises and sunsets from the fourth matrix is special, intimate.",
							"The desire to expand in all directions and causes the organization of the workplace, these people need a review, whether it is a view from the window or a view of the office space, where they can look at everyone. This also applies to work, in this subgroup everything is concerned, although it sometimes leads to dispersion, not expansion, but nonetheless. The narrowing of perception for these types, the concentration on one issue, rather uncomfortable state.",
							"These people do not like when the problems that arise obscure their view “on the open field”, they do not allow them to think big, so they try to prevent and eliminate them while they are still points on the horizon. The desire to clear the debris, remove restrictions, give room to themselves and people can be traced in various areas of human activity.",
							"The first task of this group? show the whole socion these open horizons. It is from these types closer to the end of the course, when people begin to understand what socionics is, I hear enthusiastic exclamations from what socionics can give and how much remains to be done. And the second task is to bring everyone there. Those. not just to break through \"through thorns to the stars,\" but to discover new worlds there.",
							"To see new horizons and bring socion to a new level, one must possess superpowers and supernormal abilities. You have to be the best of all, and this is another pattern of the fourth aspect. This is the top four superheroes, supermen, the league of the best of the best. It should be noted that this thesis does not mean that the representatives of this matrix are really the best or all the best people on the planet to belong only to the fourth matrix, this is the broadcast and projected personal perception. Including in the literature Conan Doyle (ESE), J. Vern (LIE), R. Jelazny (LIE), A. Dumas (ESE), and others, which well illustrates the tendency to endow significant people with super qualities.",
							"The activity of representatives of the fourth aspect is wide and large-scale. The most positive example in Russian history, illustrating this statement, the transformations carried out by PA Stolypin (FEL). The transformations of MS were no less large. Gorbachev (ESE), consistently to this day, showing openness to the world and calling for the whole world.",
							"The fourth matrix deals with everything, its platform for activity is the whole world. Representatives of these four should not be urged to think big, small problems are not interesting in principle. If social issues are considered, then globalization, if environmental issues, global warming. If the boots were dusty for Russian soldiers, then wash them in the Indian Ocean, as V.V. Zhirinovsky (EIE).",
							"The idea of the fourth matrix is most vividly observed in the US culture. The first settlers, mastering a new world for Europe, probably, for the most part belonged to the fourth matrix, as the most restless and therefore fleeing crowded Europe. But, another option is possible, the new boundless world has provided preferential conditions for its own realization to the carriers of the fourth aspect. It is in the USA that the idea of limitless possibilities is cultivated, which is very positive from a psychological point of view and brings good results.",

This is nothing more than a reflection of obstetric intervention in the psyche.",
							"The posture bearers of the aspect prefer smooth and open. Wide active gestures are characteristic, with both hands making the same movements. The change of poses is not as pronounced as in the second matrix, it is as if slightly blurred by a slow start of movement and a slow end.",

							"“In the second subgroup, all processes periodically freeze as it were. Presented the second aspect is also not in a hurry and in no hurry, it is in cramped conditions, where there is no way out. The fruit, being clamped by the uterine muscles, the rest of his life retains this clamped plastic. The movements of the second matrix are scant movements of necessity, they are always minimal and quite limited, gestures seem to run into an invisible barrier. Often, the types of the second matrix take a pose in which they rest against something, be it a pose, with their fist propped on their head — Roden's thinker, or with their elbows or shoulders on some piece of furniture.",
							"The representatives of the second aspect of the most visible muscle clamps, especially in the shoulder girdle. Sometimes it seems that they are bent only in the belt or not bent at all in the literal and figurative sense. These people longer than all other members of the socion can sit in one position absolutely straight, without changing it for hours. From personal observations, I can say that sitting for two hours in a fixed position (absolutely motionless!) For the representatives of the second matrix does not present any difficulty, a record that I observed in the group - three and a half hours without any movements.",
							"In the psyche, such a pattern manifests itself in the inertia of mental processes: “I can think for a long time with one thought, I can feel one feeling for a long time”. Another football example, but with our player. The next attack ended in vain, striker V. Onopko (LII), possessing the ball, did not make a timely transfer to the penalty area and could not accurately break through on goal. Describing this game episode in an interview, he commented on the situation: “I am running and I think, to beat or not to beat”. While Onopko thought, he ran half of the football field: “I think there is no place to run any further. Need to beat. Hit Past the gate.",
							"The situation when there is no “way out” is characteristic of the carriers of the second aspect, it is in such conditions that she feels most comfortable and begins to be active. It is in such conditions that the greatest efficiency and readiness to take the initiative is manifested.",
							"Since the fetus in the generic process has not yet separated itself from the environment, and the environment is hostile and restricts it, and the struggle with the environment has not yet begun, in the future this external restrictor is introjected and perceived as its internal restriction. “I have to educate myself”, “I have to restrain myself”, only from the representatives of the second matrix I heard the expression “socionics limits me”. For people who unconsciously copy this pattern, in most cases painful reflections are inherent: “I am trembling creature or I have the right”, doubts “can I”.",
							"Often the unconscious desire to recreate its matrix is expressed in the desire to get into difficult situations in which circumstances \"dictate\" behaviors. This may be delaying the solution of the issue until the very last moment, when there is no way out, except for how to take the only possible (not the most optimal) solution. This may be an unconscious ignoring of circumstances aggravating the situation, until negative factors reach a critical level. Another good way was suggested by the aspect bearer? to commit oneself to commitments: promised, fulfill, creating something like a debt pit for yourself.",
							"This is clearly visible on the management style, for example, in neighboring Belarus. Constant crises, difficulties, constrained living conditions of the Belarusian people often look artificial, for example, the signing on December 31 at 23:55 of the next gas contract for the next year. This is the result of the policy pursued by the famous “father” Lukashenko (LSI). This situation is clear and familiar, the US is arresting accounts, the European Union does not allow officials, Russia closes the gas valve.",
							"Life in cramped conditions is a familiar environment for the second subgroup: “I don't see a way out,” “I don't see a resolution of the situation.” Where it is possible to take some measures in advance to prevent a deterioration of the situation or simply to create better conditions, the second matrix waits patiently for it to become completely unbearable. If the contract ends, these people wait for the last day when the validity period will expire, and only after that they start looking for work. As a rule, constrained material conditions make it impossible to find an attractive option. If the company falls apart, they are the last to be fired, when there is simply nowhere to go to work, and the closed door causes them to change their usual trajectory.",
							"Of course, not all representatives of the second aspect bring the situation to a catastrophic situation, it depends on personally acceptable limits, but the described “forcedness” is observed in all.",
							"For bearers of the aspect of the workplace, when the table is in such a way that, apart from the wall, no one is visible, it does not cause negative emotions. In one of the groups on the assignment of organizing the space of the lady, LII, putting the maximum number of tables, spread all the prospective employees face to the walls, which put the rest of the training participants in a state of shock.",
							"Such isolation from everyone allows not to waste extra forces, not to be distracted by trifles, since a lot of energy is spent on switching.",
							"Change of direction, change of posture, change of activity is always clearly defined. It was so, it became different, there is always a point of refraction, the further motion vector is always clear. Turns only the entire body, the head turns with the body, the eyes look only where the head is turned.",
							"These people also prefer closed poses, but, unlike the previous aspect, they do not fold here, but sit flat. The pose has clear angles, because the situation “always forces one to sit as it should be,” elbows pressed.",
							"A glance can also be called a glance in oneself, more precisely, self-deepened and intense. The eye zone is quite intense at the muscle clamps, a look, as a rule, fixed, in one point. A similar view can be observed in A. Serebryakov (LII), in A. Adabashyan (LSI), in D. Borisova (ESI).",
							"Speech, as well as in the first aspect, is slow, but not painful. There are no jumps from topic to topic in this matrix, the conversation is supported in one direction. According to the reaction rate, this subgroup is the slowest, the first reaction is expectant, the second reaction is expectant, the third reaction is expectant and only, when it is no longer possible to wait, these types are included in the activity.

Mechanism of relations of social order (benefit) has a lot in common with the act of hypnosis - the act of benefactor on the subconscious of the beneficiary. Energy is transferred directly only if benefactor (sender) is able to somehow relax the beneficiary (receiver) and predispose him to the benefactor. With consciously critical attitude on the part of the beneficiary, the energy impulse is not transmitted. It is either blocked or even reversed, bringing into effect reverse order - a destructive process when emotional get heated causing a breakdown in the system. Information in this system undergoes inflation - it is devalued if not put into circulation immediately. The basis of the differences between inflation (benefit) rings lies in the way energy and information get used. Energy corresponds to extraversion, but also left progress.

The reason that this happens is that one shares Asking/Declaring, Positivist/Negativist and Rational/Irrational with the Semi-Dual and Mirage, and changing one's pole in those dichotomies costs too much energy to sustain. \"Club Displacement\" is my name for this. It is possible to have brief shifts to the Beneficiary and Benefactor, for example, but since they differ in Rationality and Positivist/Negativist, it can't be sustained. To use my own type as an example: ILI's are naturally Researchers (Intuitive/Logical). However, when ILI's have to work in a Pragmatist field (Sensing/Logical), then it is natural for them to take up the authoritarian, centralized methods of a Marshal (SLE), finding weakness and eliminating them. Similarly, when ILI's work in a Humanitarian (Intuitive/Ethical) field, it is natural for them to turn the commonplace upside down and advise people out of difficult life situations like an IEE.

The perception of reality turns out to be somewhat flat, but detailed. In everyday terms, representatives of these sociotypes accumulate a lot of things, but they are poorly ordered. Commutativity (displaceability) as the law of mathematical operations reflects precisely this property of this group: a + b = b + a. Commutative types are not afraid of inverted images. Apparently, therefore, they are well oriented on the ground, quickly finding familiar objects or stating their movement. And one more note.

Thanks to their ability to catch spider-like interrelations, these sociotypes well foresee or anticipate the future - trends of events. They rely on the well-known principle of \"dominoes\": one knuckle fallen down pushes the other until the whole chain falls. Therefore, behaviorally, they are always ready for the most likely event. As the reader was convinced, here I am somewhat narrowing the meaning of the concept of “associativity”, putting into it approximately the same content as J. Grinder and R. Bendler put into the concept of “anchoring” [4], i.e. it means the combination of stimulus reactions of any nature.Mathematically, associativity is written as a “bracketed” operation - an arbitrary combination of terms or factors: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).

Distributive psyche sets out ideas about the phenomena of the world in a certain order - it distributes them to the first, second, third, etc., depending on the depth of distribution. The first objects in such an orderly series are perceived clearly and concretely, the latter - as if they fall out of perception, few are taken into account. Distributive sociotypes are harder to tolerate uncertainty (equiprobability of outcomes), since they lose their foothold - the ability to distribute forces and means for a specific goal. Therefore, they strive to move as quickly as possible to a steady state — either to return to the old one, or to go back to the new. These are the most organized and punctual members of society, strictly meeting the time schedule and technological discipline. By virtue of these qualities, by their share in a team or social stratum, one can assess its stability and adherence to traditions. The things with which they surround themselves are smaller than those of the Commutative, but they are contained in a greater order. Mathematically, a distribution law can be written as a replacement for a product by a sum, that is, as an operation “opening the brackets”: a (b + c) = ab + ac. The common factor “a” is evenly distributed among all the terms, symbolically expressing a strongly cultivated tradition.

Shechter and Kobrinskaya write that in the group “the atmosphere is businesslike, even business jokes”, which is generally predictable. After all, all the functions of the vital block and the superego block of any member of the group are represented in the leading blocks of other TIMs. In other words, any member of this group is “driven” into its “Ego” block, because all positions except the “Ego” block are “occupied”. A person cannot express himself fairly freely in any of the functions of the contact block, except for the creative one, since enters into competition with someone from the group. By the nature of the interaction, this group very much resembles Group 2 “Locks” or “Equilibrium”. If we proceed from the nature of intertype relationships (AI), we can assume the following. The interaction with the activator will be the most intense, while the instability of the activation relationship will be enhanced by the quasi-identity relationship, and the superego will not stabilize the group and provide the necessary support. Continuing the course of reasoning, we can note the following. The authors write that the participants \"were simply offered communication for approximately 20-30 minutes.\" And further, \"in joint actions, each has its own role and responsibilities.\" It is not at all clear what the group members did after all, just communicated or performed joint actions, and if the latter, how did they manage to find topics for discussion in a given time, find a common language, agree on joint actions, and produce these actions. With what speed should all the above described happen? “After some time (for members of the group, author) there is a need for rest, because the intensity of communication is great. \" Most likely, the interaction in the group did not go beyond communication. In their work, Schechter and Kobrinskaya call this group \"mobilization.\" Meanwhile, in the description of group effects there is not a hint of mobilization, in contrast to the group described by them as the “progress ring” or “quadra”, where there is a “feeling of recovery, mobilization” [6]. Conclusion: it is clear that the name of the group does not reflect the essence of the intragroup effect, joint activity, if it is not episodic in nature, is difficult, the group requires further study due to the inconsistency of the described group effects.”"

Stress threatens these types with challenging doubts and in the end leads them to break internally (\"giants with feet of clay\").

In other words, since all functions of the information metabolism are in the expert zone of its members, any information in the group is assessed adequately and is perceived in detail. Since there are no priorities and no avoiding - any information is valuable, I would call this group a “balance” group. The experience of communication in such a group confirms the justification of such a name. As a participant, the author happened to be in two such stable groups for a long time (from several hours to several days) under conditions of intensive interaction. The following information can be regarded as the author's self-report, which does not contradict the opinion of two more members of one of the groups. Communication is easy, on an equal footing, any proposal is agreed, no one imposes his decisions. But at the same time, the group feels stiff, light tension because any proposal must pass the approval of all members of the group, although the group always came to a consensus. From the group there is a feeling of some awkwardness. This can be compared to a heavy pendulum. When someone in the equilibrium group makes a proposal for joint actions, before the group makes a decision, you have to wait until the whole system comes to equilibrium again. If the group begins to act, then it as a heavy flywheel cannot be quickly unwound and cannot be quickly stopped. The initial rise and enthusiasm from the meeting quickly gives way to a smooth relationship. There are no intellectual disputes in the group and no emotional support, even between duals. Communication is a dyad: repayment, superego, duals. There are no proposals for joint activities requiring any efforts, each member of the group understands that they should not do this. Because the initiatives will either not be supported or will require lengthy approvals, which is too energy-consuming. From communication in the group does not feel the energy recovery, the topics of communication are extremely superficial. At the same time, even prolonged communication does not bore you.”"

Deltas are prone to see the merit in exploring multiple possibilities, disciplines and schools of thought, which can manifest as being open minded and accepting of alternative lifestyles.

Their registration of reality will be stirring, radiant and permeable while objects are perceived memetically as abstract icons of the those emotional qualities. This causes Deltas to become the embodiments of their surreal impressions, living out the essential abstractions they sense in life through their own vessel. This leads Deltas to have a dainty, fairy-like quality that appears otherworldly. A technical term which can be used to summarize them would be: Etherealists, or Embodied Impressionists."

However Delta types have a modular data structure, causing the objective world to be understood as a series of discrete (Si) episodes and anecdotes aggregated together to form a comprehensive understanding of the natural world. This modular mode of understanding information, combined with Te's systematic approach to causality, creates an scientific mode of comprehending life, pressuring Deltas to be Modular Empiricists. Wherever their profession lies, they will use this engineering mentality to solve problems at the specific and contextual level. Hence, a technical term which can be used to summarize them would be: Bureaucrats."
